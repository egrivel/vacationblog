Of course Marching Monkey, who accompanies us on all our travels. Koala is our speaker set, so we can listen to audio books on Nicoline&apos;s MP3 player.

We got up fairly early, fed the cats, had breakfast, loaded up the dishwasher, and packed our stuff into the car. When that was done and it still wasn&apos;t time to leave, I picked about a pound of tomatoes to give to Terry, to deliver together with the house key. She&apos;s going to rescue the stuff in the freezer in case of a power outage. You never know during hurricane season.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By 9.15 we were on our way and by about 11.30 we were at a rest stop along the New Jersey Turnpike having lunch. New Jersey folks must be very disputatious. Automated signs over the highway can not only tell you to slow down, but also *why* you should slow down: heavy traffic, accident, road work, weather conditions, and who knows what else. Really, if the Turnpike Authority doesn&apos;t tell people why they should slow down, they&apos;ll give them a hard time about it?  Luckily the signs didn&apos;t light up while we drove to New York, but once we made it past Elizabeth, NJ, which reminded us of our time in the Garden State and how we used to take Frank and Mark to Ikea at Elizabeth, which allowed unlimited time in the ball pit, and then we&apos;d sometimes have lunch or a snack there in the restaurant overlooking Newark Airport, but I digress, we ran into very heavy traffic toward the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. The only thing that bothered us was that the State of New York apparently doesn&apos;t care to put up welcome signs like every other state, so we missed out on that picture.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Still,  we found the Howard Johnson motel on Jamaica Avenue in Queens quite easily, and it&apos;s literally half a block from the Long Island Rail Road station Queens Village, so getting to Coney Island was a cinch, albeit a time-consuming one. It took us about an hour to get there. Coney Island is apparently a Yankee corruption of \"Konijnen Eiland\" (rabbit island). I sure hope they manage to keep the bunnies in check; it can&apos;t be wonderful for their flood defenses to have Long Island riddled with furiously tunneling bunnies. Anyway, we waded in the surf for a bit, sat on the beach, and walked on the boardwalk. Of course we rode in the ferris wheel and ate a hot dog at Nathan&apos;s. Then we went back to the boardwalk and waited until it got dark enough for Eric to take pictures of the luna park attractions all lit up. We had lugged along the tripod that is sturdy enough to catch elephants with especially for that purpose. I understand the need for a tripod for nighttime picture taking, but oh. my. gods. Is that thing heavy and unwieldy! You stand out like a sore thumb anyway as a tourist in New York City, but this accentuated our provincialism mercilessly.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Also, whatever the advantage to brain development in certain animal species from city-dwelling, the disadvantage of visiting a city is that there are entirely too many people. Never mind rabbits breeding like konijnen, people sure do their part. But we managed to brave our travails and were even rewarded with a visit to a Brooklyn Target store while we waited for the train back to Queens Village to pull into the station where they had an escalator for shopping carts. Of course, one of the natives managed to jam the thing with a family pack of paper towels, but whatever. You don&apos;t see elevators, either for carts or for people, at the suburban stores we usually visit.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Long (Island) story short, we made it back to the motel, had a shower and updated the blog. That&apos;s all, folks. For today, anyway.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;PS For some reason, I can&apos;t persuade my laptop to log into Eric&apos;s laptop, so I don&apos;t have access to pictures.

I guess it is from all those air-conditioned cars; they cool down the cars but the heat is pumped into the tunnels and the stations. Because otherwise you would expect it to be cooler underground, right?

The tour started out with a long talk by the rabbi, rabbi Epstein, which was actually pretty interesting. A lot of the things he said, about relationships and about what matters in life, when you would take the religion out of it, made a lot of sense. Some of the same things about relationships that we have tried to emphasize to our sons: when you want to get serious with a relationship, make sure you agree on the things that are really important. The important thing of a relationship is not what you get out of it, but what you can bring into it. Stuff like that. Other parts of the explanation didn&apos;t make any sense at all, and had logical jumps that I guess  you would have to take on faith, because the logic just wasn&apos;t there.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the introduction the tour got started with a stop at a prayer center, followed by a repair shop where they check out and repair the black boxes Jews use while praying, and ended with lunch in a Kosher deli. [20130828-123245] I&apos;m leaving it up to Nicoline to give a more detailed description of this whole tour. I have to say, though, that a couple of times during the explanations I was reminded of Jewish co-workers and felt I got a little bit better understanding of them and their life.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130828-111227] [20130828-112448] [20130828-115536] [20130828-115716] [20130828-120003]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The second goal for today was the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. [20130828-160809] We were here an hour early and watched part of the introductory movie, then went on the walking tour \"Hard Times.\" Even though the word \"tenement\"basically includes any apartment building, the term usually refers to the bottom-of-the-line housing for immigrant families. On our tour, we got to see reconstructed apartments of two families, one from around the 1870s and one from around the 1930s. There was a lot of explanation of how these people lived, also relating some of their lives with immigration policies of today. Unfortunately, photography was not allowed, so no photos of the inside.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The third goal for today was B&amp;H, the photography / video superstore on 9th Avenue. [20130828-164000] This store is famous for its quality service, its knowledgeable personnel, and for closing for the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. In fact, their website remains up, but they do not accept on-line orders until the end of the Sabbath or the holiday. And yes, wandering around in the store is amazing. I tried a particular lens for my camera that I have been curious about, and Nicoline found an MP3 player we may be considering buying.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The final goal for today was to have \"real Belgian fries\" at Pommes Frites on 2nd Avenue. [20130828-183415] And yes, the fries are really close to the \"real deal\", with many different sauces to choose from.','2013-08-29 02:07:01','D','2013-08-29 01:40:30','N'),('2013-maine','20130828D0001','nicoline','20130828','New York City','Just got back to the hotel from a day of traversing New York City by train and metro. It&apos;s great that it&apos;s such a tolerant city; nobody gives a damn what you do as long as you&apos;re not bothering anybody else and on the subway you see a great cross section of humanity. But there are so many of them! I&apos;m suppose that means we&apos;ve become irredeemably suburban, but after a whole day of dealing with those cross sections, both Eric and I are completely done in. We bought a beer (for me) and an ice cream (for Eric) at the corner store, had a quick shower and now it&apos;s time to report on our day.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We traveled to the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn for a Chassidic Discovery Tour. Those kinds of groups always fascinate me. I wonder how they make somewhat sane and rational men and women believe all that stuff. Like the men are supposed to study for an hour and a half every day, including Saturday, and pray in the synagogue for a good bit of time after that. So how they fit in work I don&apos;t know. They&apos;re supposedly adhering to the rules set by an late 18th century Russian rabbi, and their rules are full observances that may or may not have made sense in tsarist Russia, but what mental acrobatics make it OK to use cell phones and iPods and what not, but not magazines, radio, television and the internet? But it&apos;s OK to use the internet to have a 24/7 view of the goings-on in the synagogue that we got to visit. Of course, being unkosher infidels, we did not visit the synagogue itself, but watched the proceedings from behind one-way glass like you see in crime series when they line up possible suspects. [20130828-093841] [20130828-112448]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But you always learn something. For example, I didn&apos;t know that the tefillin, the small black boxes attached to leather straps that orthodox Jewish men wear during prayer are not made of wood but of leather, and that the one they wear on their head is different from the one the wear on their arm. In India, where there is apparently also a sizable Jewish community, they import the tefillin, because Hindus aren&apos;t allowed to kill cows (though it&apos;s OK apparently if the cow dies of old age). Only men use tefillin, because women are already so spiritually pure and what not that they don&apos;t need to. Supposedly the tefillin work somewhat like spiritual accupuncture by applying pressure on especially sensitive points. Or something. [20130828-115751] [20130828-120003] [20130828-120645]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Chassidic boys and girls are separated from an early age, and must not touch one another at all, because if they let go of those rules even a little bit, the men allegedly turn into rabid beasts and they&apos;d defile all the women without - gasp! - marrying and procreating. Did you know that if Hassidic couples can&apos;t conceive, it&apos;s OK for them to use IVF? Except they can only have it done at Cornell, because Cornell has a rabbi on staff whose job it is to make sure that all the fluids go where they&apos;re supposed to and aren&apos;t intermingled with those of heathens. Also, one of the 613 commandments Jews are supposed to follow is that they do not wear clothing that combines wool and linen. Of course, with all the made in China or Bangladesh or the gods only know where stuff comes from nowadays, who knows exactly what&apos;s in a piece of clothing, right? But not to worry, a store like Saks Fifth Avenue employs a rabbi who comes in once a month to check that a wool suit doesn&apos;t have its buttons sewn on with linen thread and he uses a microscope to figure this out. So I asked what they did before they had microscopes, but apparently people could trust their tailors back then. Any other combination of materials is fine, so wear all the polyester-cotton blends you like, it&apos;s just the wool-linen combination that is an abomination in the eyes of the lord. Am I to understand that he keeps a big ledger in the sky in which he tallies up any demerits you earn for breaking such persnickety commandments? And that if the demerits get above a certain number, you don&apos;t get to go to heaven? Or can you work them off by doing good works or something?&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Unfortunately, the rabbi did not answer any of those questions, so we continued on our unenlightened way to the Lower East Side to the Tenement Museum. Before laws were put in place in the early 20th century, tenements did not have running water or indoor plumbing of any kind. In fact, the landlords fought tooth and nail, all the way to the Supreme Court, to keep from having to put in privies and later two indoor flushing toilets per floor. Considering that as many as 12 people shared one 325 sq.ft. apartment and there were four apartments per floor, this could hardly be called excessively luxurious by any stretch of the imagination. By 1935 mayor LaGuardia made such dwellings illegal, with the result that some of the tenements were so to speak frozen in time. Some were used for storage, but no one lived there or took an interest in them until the late 1980s-early 1990s, when the Tenement Museum acquired some of the properties and started looking at them the way an archeologist looks at Nineveh. One of the apartments has now been restored to what it would have looked like ca. 1870, and another ca. 1925. Both are fascinating examples of how the other half lived in those days. Unfortunately, no photography is allowed inside the apartments, so you&apos;ll have to make do with some outside views. [20130828-140140] [20130828-150243] [20130828-160809]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At any rate, we were glad to be back in the here with respect to creature comforts. And even, truth be told, a little more than comforts. Eric really wanted to visit B&amp;H, a huge photography store on the corner of 9th Ave and 34th St. It&apos;s his go-to place for photography stuff. As it happens, it is owned by orthodox Jews and they shut down their website every week in observance of Sabbath and Jewish holidays. It&apos;s not a store that would normally be high on my list, but I told Eric that he should at least take the opportunity to look at carbon fiber tripods to replace the elephant-hunting one he now lugs about. Or that I lug about, as the case may be, because he already carries a 40 lbs back pack of photography equipment. He saw a couple of nice ones, but of course he wants to take the time properly research the various brands etc. so he didn&apos;t buy anything. But that&apos;s OK, B&amp;H does a great job shipping stuff around the country. It&apos;s happened more than once that he selected the low-cost shipping option, thinking that the item he ordered wouldn&apos;t come in for a couple of days but it was actually delivered to our doorstep the very next day. [20130828-163703] [20130828-163835] [20130828-170030]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The last item on our list for today was to go have real Belgian fries for dinner. Proper fries, with plenty of sauce for dipping. There&apos;s a frietkot on Second Ave. where we indulged ourselves and it was really good. Unfortunately, it was a tad out of the way, so we had to trudge up and down Second Ave. to get from the subway station to the frietkot and back again, but it was worth it. On the way back to the hotel in Queens we were fortunate enough to make the 7:35 LIRR from Atlantic Center to Hempstead, so we were \"home\" by 8.30 and particularly thankful to kick off our shoes.

So we made this our first destination for today. Having done no research beforehand, we found the town but could not find anything like a museum, historical markers, anything of the kind. We finally stopped at the post office we stumbled upon, to at least have a picture with \"Levittown\" in it, and took the opportunity to buy some stamps. When we mentioned we were looking for a Levittown museum or something like that, the clerk came around from behind his counter and took us to the hallway, where there was an original map of Levittown hidden behind a paper screen. Using this map, he showed us how to get to the library.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-105405] In the library we spent 45 minutes reading up on the history of the town, which was the first \"suburbia\" created in the years after World War II. Thousands of houses were built using the Henry Ford assembly line principles - there were five different models on the outside but inside all houses were essentially the same. However, the houses were of remarkable quality and came with ammenities like a fridge and washer, and built-in book cases. The 1950 models even came with a TV. They were really a boon for the new burgeoning middle class!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-120919] After visiting the library we drove around randomly through some of the neighborhoods and it is fascinating how now, 65 years later, the houses that started out almost identical all look very different now. And it still looks to be a thriving middle-class neighborhood where it would be a pleasure to live and raise a family!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-104734] [20130829-115036] [20130829-115141] [20130829-115749] [20130829-121747]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-130913] Next we went to Sagamore Hill, president Teddy Roosevelt&apos;s house in Oyster Bay. The house itself is being renovated and therefore inaccessible, but we visited the museum telling the story of Teddy Roosevelt&apos;s life. He was a politician of the type that we would need again. In his first two years as governor, he \"reformed the state civil service, increased taxes on corporations, improved factory safety inspections, regulated sweat shops and child labor and established a commission to oversee the scientific management of the state&apos;s forests and natural resources.\"&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-141036] After visiting the museum, we hiked the \"nature trail\" which was a little bit disappointing. The bridge to the beach was closed because of damage from hurricane Sandy and the trail itself wasn&apos;t very spectecular. But at least we got to stretch out legs. But we did see some big mushrooms (Nicoline&apos;s foot in the photo to show the size).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-130059] [20130829-133453] [20130829-140442] [20130829-141635] [20130829-144156]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-174703] From Sagamore Hill we took route 25-A and then route 25 all the way to the tip on Long Island called Orient Point, where we had booked a place on the ferry to New London, CT. We had played it safe and booked a fare on the 8:00 ferry, but we were there early so we ended up on the 6:00 ferry. As it turned out, this ship was built as the \"USS LST-510\" during World War II and actually participated in the D-Day landing at Normandy!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130829-174517] [20130829-180006] [20130829-183349] [20130829-192645] [20130829-192803]&lf;&nl;','2013-08-30 02:31:03','D','2013-08-30 02:31:03','N'),('2013-maine','20130829D0002','nicoline','20130829','History','Y&apos;all will have to be patient with me tonight, because I&apos;m enjoying chocolate-ganache covered cheesecake while I&apos;m working on a blog entry. The drive from the ferry terminal at New London, Conn. turned out to be a short one. An exit or two north we decided to call it a day, checked into an Econo Lodge and had dinner at the Mystic Diner, where a very nice waitress recommended this particular variety of cheesecake. It is very good. Eric doesn&apos;t like cheesecake, so I get to eat it all by myself :-) Today was a day full of history, wittingly or unwittingly, so if you don&apos;t feel like a history lesson, feel free to skip this entry.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We left the HoJo in Queens at about 9:30 this morning and managed to find the Long Island Expressway (LIE) pretty easily (that tends to happen when Eric navigates). It was only about 30 minutes to Oyster Bay, but I had noticed when I pulled up a Google map of the area that if we should take the exit to the south of the LIE we would end up in Levittown. This being pretty much the template for post-World War II suburbs around the country, we decided to take a look around. We found it, and a friendly post office guy at the Levittown post office showed us how to get to the Levittown library, which was sure to have more information on the town&apos;s history. So we spend an hour or so at the library, going through some of the books they have on the subject. One of the first things we noticed was a mural, which had graced one of Levittown&apos;s schools until 1984, when it was closed. From left to right, it depicts \"The Scarlet Letter,\" \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" \"MacBeth,\" \"Canterbury Tales,\" and \"Beowulf.\" By 1984, the baby boom had clearly abated to the extend that Levittown no longer needed all the 11 elementary, 3 junior, and 3 senior high schools that had been in operation at the end of the baby boom in 1968. [20130829-104915]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;A pretty amazing development, when you consider that in 1947, the area same area was known as Island Trees and needed only one three-room school with two teachers. Long Island settlement dates back to 1644, when a group of Englishmen from Connecticut who had been given land as a thank-you for their effort in the Pequot War came down south. Dutchmen arrived a little while later, and the county that includes Levittown is called Nassau County (est. 1899) to this day.  [20130829-095653] Until the early 20th century, the area was farmland and farmers grew so many cucumbers (among other things) that several pickling plants operated in the area.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;However, by the late 1930s a blight, golden nematodes, had struck the potato crop in the Island Trees area. This probably helped Brooklynite and World War II veteran William J. Levitt acquire the land pretty cheaply. Levitt had earned his construction chops in the construction company owned by his father before the war, but the need for speedy, cheap, and sturdy construction of military bases in the Pacific allowed Levitt to develop a way to mass-produce housing at a time when recently demobilized GIs and their families were clamoring for homes. Levitt turned his skills to building a town on the former potato land, and the result was that by 1948, several thousand people lived there. Of course, there were some problems. [20130829-121448] Until 1948, Levittown schools operated in Quonset huts because material shortages made it impossible to build both houses and schools. Also, the earliest homeowner contracts contained a clause that forbade black or Asian people to own Levitt homes. As Levitt said: \"We can solve a housing problem or we can try to solve a racial problem, but we cannot combine the two.\" However, this clause was removed as early as 1948, following a Supreme Court ruling that said that racial covenants could not be enforced.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Levittown had a very active community association from the very start. The Levittown Volunteer Fire Department was established in 1951. A monument outside one of the fire stations commemorates Lt. Ronald T. Kerwin, who was killed on September 11, 2001. [20130829-102828]  the library is also one of the oldest institutions in the town, operating out of a book mobile at first. Many stores did the same. Until stores could be built, businesses made deliveries of all kinds of things, from baby formula to milk and groceries. Levittown had three public swimming pools and was connected to public transport so that the wives would not be stranded miles from anywhere while the husbands used the car - if they even had one - to get to work.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;This legacy of community involvement stood Levittown in good stead when the original covenant was due to expire in 1976, which could potentially have opened the door for rezoning and infill development. The Levittown Property Owners Association&apos;s board voted to keep the restrictions in place, whereupon several developers took the LPOA to court. The case was fought all the way to the Supreme Court, with the result that the original covenant restrictions were upheld in the mid-1980s. This doesn&apos;t mean that the LPOA acts like your regular garden variety HOA-nazis. The houses, Cape Cods and ranchers, no longer look all the same. It just means that homeowners banded together to defend their interests against developers. [20130829-115036] [20130829-115141] [20130829-115402] [20130829-115749] [20130829-120919]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;That makes it appropriate to juxtapose Levittown with a resident of Long Island with a much longer pedigree: Theodore Roosevelt. We visited his estate, Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay, which is now a National Historic Site, after our visit to Levittown. TR is well-known as a reformer. According to one of the displays in the museum, he visited the office of Jacob Riis, author of \"How the Other Half Lives\" about the squalor and misery of the tenements, and left his card with the note: \"I read your book and I am here to help.\" One of the things he insisted upon was a square deal for the working man, so that a person would have a job that covered more than just the very basics, and would, at the end of the day, leave him with enough time and energy to do his part in the governance of his town or neighborhood. He was also the first president to receive a black person, Booker T. Washington, at the White House as a guest, and generally viewed racial discrimination on the same level as discrimination based on national origin or creed. [20130829-135302]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Lest you think he&apos;s a saint, he was also one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the Spanish-American War of 1898 and an avowed imperialist and disciple of power politics. During his presidency the U.S. helped foment an uprising in a province of Columbia we now call Panama, so that it could seceded and let the United States come in  to build the Panama Canal, which had originally been planned to run through Nicaragua. Roosevelt&apos;s enthusiasm for war as the supreme manly pursuit cost him dearly in personal terms. His son Quentin was killed in 1918, and his son Theodore, jr. during the Normandy Invasion in 1944. [20130829-144156]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Oyster Bay we drove east along U.S. 25A all the way to Orient Point, from where we were to take the Cross Sound Ferry at 8 p.m. We had plenty of time, and it&apos;s only about 80 miles, but we both thought it was farther than it looked on a map. It is called *Long* Island for a reason, I suppose. Nevertheless, we got to Orient Point before the 6 p.m. sailing of the ferry, and since they had enough space, they let us go on the earlier one. Which was a stroke of luck, because \"[t]he Cape Henlopen Ferry was built as a World War II landing craft (LST 510) in Jeffersonville, Indiana and participated in the D-day invasion at Normandy,\" according to longislandferry.com. We wouldn&apos;t have noticed it, but for a fellow passenger pointing out a sign to someone in her party, which I happened to overhear. I asked Eric to take a picture of it, and when we got to the motel - which has an excellent wifi network - he found out that it had been a D-Day landing craft. Who would&apos;ve thunk...

The photo in this paragraph has the sauna (in an old barn) on the left, the hot tub in the middle and the swimming pool on the right. This is where we also ended up today: as I&apos;m writing this, we&apos;ve spent the past hour hopping between heated pool (cool), hot tub (hot) and sauna (hotter). I am liking this clothing optional place; life is very relaxed here. It&apos;s only 7, we still have to go out for dinner though -- we wanted to do the sauna before having an extensive dinner and Nicoline trying some beer.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-084015] [20130831-084058a] [20130831-084115] [20130831-084213]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-092803] We spent most of our time today in the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath. There is an indoor museum part with many artifact and models related to Maine maritime history, and then there are different additional buildings with various different expositions. You know, I still have a hard time imagining people going out to sea with these relatively small ships!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-094832] [20130831-100319] [20130831-103803] [20130831-104015] [20130831-101609]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-105130] Outside is also a steel sculpture hinting at the shape of the largest wooden schooner built in the U.S., the \"Wyoming.\" This schooner was built on just about exactly the spot of the sculpture. When finished in 1909, it was used to haul coal from Virginia to New England.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-132805] One thing that amazes me, and I remember being surprised by it when we visited the \"Batavia werf\" in Holland in 2010, that they make these wooden ships with beams directly side-by-side, which are then covered by planks on both the outside and the inside, as can be seen on this photo of a section of a ship hull. I keep thinking that there are beams every couple of feet with planks on the outside, but when you see pictures of the inside of these wooden sailing ships with beams every few feet, these beams are actually attached to the inside of this triple-layer hull. The other remarkable thing is that they didn&apos;t use iron nails but wooden pigs to connect all the wood pieces together. That way it didn&apos;t rust!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-125722] As part of the museum visit, we took a tour on the Kennebec river with a small tour boat. We went down the Kennebec river a little bit, saw a harbor seal, then went back up past the Bath Iron Works (a company building navy ships) and the town of Bath.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-120554] [20130831-121147] [20130831-121717] [20130831-123415] [20130831-124152]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-115036] Finally we visited the \"Herman Zwicker\" which used to go out fishing for cod. The ship would stay out for weeks, with the crew going out in twelve tiny rowboats, setting lines, hauling them up, and collecting the fish in the boat. It must have been incredible hard work.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-131011] [20130831-131124] [20130831-131958] [20130831-131900] [20130831-132036]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-153417] After the museum in Bath we visited the L.L. Bean store in Freeport, the largest L.L. Bean store in the world. There are actually multiple stores side-by-side, including one with home furnishings and one with hunting and fishing gear. We went into the outdoor stuff store, the one with the famous huge shoe in front of it. One nice detail was that in the shoe department, they had a section of rock on which to try out the shoes, which makes a lot of sense when you&apos;re selling hiking shoes...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130831-153437] [20130831-153700] [20130831-155036] [20130831-160217]','2013-09-01 01:36:43','D','2013-09-01 01:36:43','N'),('2013-maine','20130831D0002','nicoline','20130831','Bath','After a good night&apos;s sleep thanks to Old Rasputin we woke up to the smell of coffee and trudged downstairs to get some. Richard, the owner of the Richmond Inn, was up and about and fixed us some sticky buns. We sat and had coffee and chatted. The man has led an adventuresome life, to say the least. Joined the Navy, first aboard an aircraft carrier, and later he volunteered for submarine service. Then he left the Navy and worked for a defense contractor on some part of the Gemini program. He&apos;s also been a wildlife and travel photographer. If you look at the art work all over the place, he&apos;s been absolutely everywhere. Now he owns a bed and breakfast with a sauna, which attracts a big crowd of locals as well as return B&amp;B customers. [20130831-084015] [20130831-084058a]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It would have been fascinating to sit and chat with Richard all day, but he no doubt had stuff to do and we wanted to visit the Maine Maritime Museum, so we excused ourselves after an hour or so and went on our way. There is quite a lot I don&apos;t know about history. For example, I didn&apos;t know that there had been a big Civil War battle (on sea) in Maine. Look it up, it&apos;s the Battle of Portland Harbor, June 27, 1863. As Canada was neutral during the Civil War, it drew quite a few Confederate ships looking to take on supplies to smuggle back through the Union blockade into the Confederacy, or for Union ships to raid, as the CSS Alabama did until she was sunk by the USS Kearsarge on June 19, 1864. Maine also sent more men into battle per capita than any other state in the Union.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Another thing I was surprised to learn was that there had been an English settlement by the Plymouth company on the Maine coast in Popham, on the mouth of the Kennebec River, that predates Jamestown, which was settled by the Virginia company a month or so later. Popham didn&apos;t survive its first winter, so it doesn&apos;t \"count\" the way Jamestown does. Volunteers are raising funds and trying to build a replica of the first and last ship built at Popham, ironically called the Virginia. [20130831-123513]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Ships from Maine also had pretty extensive trading ties with the Far East, which I would have thought the English and the Dutch pretty much had locked up in those days. Nowadays, there&apos;s apparently a weather station in the North Atlantic that&apos;s manned by crews from the U.S. and The Netherlands in turn. I have no idea why. It makes no sense geographically... The station is close to Greenland, so why not the Danes? Somebody explain this to me. [20130831-102313]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After we had taken a cruise on the Kennebec River and seen everything we wanted to see at the museum - which was by no means everything, but there&apos;s only so much you can take in, and we&apos;d been there for four hours already - we went into the town of Bath. That didn&apos;t take much of our time, as it&apos;s a pretty small place and the downtown area consists of about two or three blocks. So we decided to back track a little and go to Freeport to see the huge L.L. Bean store with its shoe outside. It was fun to look at stuff, but we didn&apos;t really need anything in the way of clothing or shoes, so we decided to head back to Richmond and see if we could use the sauna. Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t open until 6, but we used the pool in the meantime, which is also nice if a little cold, even though it&apos;s indoors. [20130831-120906] [20130831-121147] [20130831-121717] [20130831-143130] [20130831-153437]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Neither Eric nor I had ever been in a sauna before, so we could only stand it for maybe ten minutes at the time, but the cool down in the pool afterwards was great! I had been dreading plunging into cold water right from the sauna, because I&apos;m wimpy that way, but it actually felt really good! So we did another go-around in the sauna and also in the hot tub, until we decided it had been enough and it was time to work on our blog (and check facebook and stuff, of course).  The sauna is in the building to the left. The one with the Stars &amp; Stripes is the pool.  [20130831-084131]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We thought we&apos;d go down to <a href=\"http://theoldgoat.com/\"> the Old Goat Pub </a> again tonight, grab a sandwich and listen to some life music. We got the music, all right, but the kitchen had closed before we got there. So we just had two drinks each (and some potato chips) and decided to call it a night :-) On the other hand, I did learn that the city of Tilburg has its own brewing company and makes a very nice dark beer called the Tilburg. How come I have to travel half way around the world to a town in the middle of nowhere to find out about this?

I&apos;m not sure if the heat is good for a bathing suit, and I would think it would be so uncomfortable!

Well, it didn&apos;t. In fact, the weather got progressively worse. We found the cottage where we&apos;re staying until Friday pretty easily. It&apos;s right in the flight path of an airfield, but on the upside, it&apos;s not like it&apos;s Bangor International Airport, so I think we&apos;ll be OK.

It&apos;s been raining and miserable and dreary all day. He took a couple of pictures on the way, but nothing like the 150-200 or so he normally does. We came upon and stopped at a second hand book store and added to our collection of Agatha Christies, and we had lunch at an Irish pub in Ellsworth which had the slowest service anywhere on the East Coast. Seriously. Thirty-five minutes before they managed to serve a Reuben and a burger. What&apos;s up with that? The food was OK, though, and it kept us out of the pouring rain. I would&apos;ve tried the lobster ale, but it didn&apos;t seem to be on the menu anymore and it would probably have taken too long anyway. Besides, the weather didn&apos;t exactly make you long for a cold one.

That went surprisingly smoothly. I googled laundromats, found a couple in Bar Harbor, and, having seen that&apos;s it&apos;s a really small town, we just drove over, took a fairly random left turn into town and happened upon one of the ones I had seen online. By the time the laundry was done, it was getting foggy and dark, so I suggested we stop somewhere to pick up something to drink. And guess what? There was a big supermarket right behind the laundromat where I found a bottle of St. Remy cognac, marked down to $11.99. Got an 8-pack of Coke for Eric, and we&apos;re all set for tonight (and the next couple of nights, FYI). Tomorrow we&apos;ll head into Acadia National Park and if the weather permits, we&apos;ll go kayaking.

For one thing, I keep forgetting to dry off the lens of my camera, having the water droplets ruin the photos.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130902-111615] We passed by a number of second-hand book stores. We stopped by the first one only, owned by Chester H.

The observation deck can be seen on top of the first bridge pillar.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130902-134741] For lunch we eat at Finn&apos;s in Elsworth. Since we&apos;re only a few miles away from the place where we have a reservation, and we&apos;re not supposed to show up before two, it makes sense to have lunch first. The food was OK, but they were taking a long time with it, so overall it&apos;s not a place I would recommend.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130902-151436] We arrive at the Open Hearth Cottages at exactly five minutes past two.

But more about that later.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130903-093707] We started out at the visitor center, where one of the signs gave a tantalizing titbit of information: that Somes Sound is \"the only fjord on the east coast of the United States.\" That is something we will have to look into later. The ranger wasn&apos;t much help, by the way. When we were talking about a \"moderate\" hike, he suggested to walk the carriage ways, or a walk around Jordan Pond. Those are not hikes, they are strolls! So we looked at the various brochures ourselves and found one that was labeled as \"moderate\" that sounded much more like what we had in mind: to the summit of Gorham Mountain and back along the road.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130903-084737] [20130903-085234] [20130903-084254] [20130903-093711]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130903-101518] In order to get to the starting point of the trail, we had to drive the Park Loop Road, a road that goes around the park.

Interestingly, at one point there was a waterfall on one side of the road, the water of which went under the road and at the other side ran into the sea.

We went to the visitor center as soon as it opened, but waited until the horde had finished interrogating the park rangers on every conceivable subject. Instead, we browsed the gift shop, where we found a water proof hiking map, a new ANP bumper sticker to put next to the one we got in Utah last year, and a post card. Then we sat through a 12-minutes video on the history and the purpose of the park. Unfortunately, it was not very informative, but the pictures were absolutely gorgeous!

He pointed us to Gorham Mountain, saying it would involve hiking over boulders, but nothing too strenuous. Well, I&apos;d sure hate to see any trail he describes as difficult! Eric and I were soon drenched in sweat from head to toe, so that waterproof map came in handy, even if it wasn&apos;t the rain that was the problem. By the way, if you look closely at some of the pictures below, you&apos;ll see either a Bates cairn, which is small stone \"table\" with a pointy stone on top to mark the direction, or blue blazes.

If the sky had been any clearer, I&apos;m sure Eric would have gotten twice the number of pictures he did, which would mean he&apos;d be processing them until about midnight or so. [20130903-095648] [20130903-095745] [20130903-103504]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The foggy weather did nothing to deter any of the other folks who had elected, like us, to stay in town past Labor Day, thinking that traffic would be more manageable that way. Unfortunately, that was a bit of a miscalculation on our part. Bar Harbor is kind of like Ocean City, only smaller, and traffic in Acadia was bad enough to remind us of when we visited Yellowstone on our trip around the country in 2007. It looked pretty  much like the Capital Beltway at 8 a.m. on a Monday morning.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Even though the summer crowds had thinned out, according to the locals, there were still entirely too many people. We had wanted to have tea and a popover at the Jordan Pond House, but we had to park at some overflow parking lot, and even there it was difficult to find a spot. The restaurant was packed, and we both thought that what they charged for it was absolutely ridiculous, so we gave it a miss.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Instead, we drove on to take a look at Somes Sound, which the park bills as the only fjord on the East Coast, but which is not actually steeply walled enough to count as a fjord. Therefore, they call it a <a href= \"http://www.maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/marine/sites/nov98.htm\"> fjard. </a> I suppose it makes sense to somebody. But it looked lovely in the late afternoon sun, and Northeast Harbor, the town we drove through to get there, looked like Bar Harbor&apos;s more upscale sister. None of the tacky souvenir shops and pizza places. [20130903-152038] [20130903-152449] [20130903-152710]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Still, we had to drive back to Bar Harbor to make a reservation for a sea kayaking tour on Thursday. We had hoped to get on one tomorrow, but they were all booked up. Making that reservation about did us in, not because they gave us a hard time about it, but because we were tired. Neither of us felt like going into any kind of restaurant. I doubt we&apos;d have been welcome, still in our sweaty, smelly hiking outfits. So we stopped by the supermarket once again to pick up a sandwich, drove back to the cottage, and called it a day.

It&apos;s in a beautiful old Federalist mansion called the Tisdale House, right in downtown Ellsworth. According to a flyer from the library, the house was built in 1807 by Col. Meltiah Jordan, a veteran of the Revolutionary War. Seth Tisdale, a boat builder from Massachusetts was the fourth owner. The fifth one, George Nixon Black, a great-grandson of Col. Jordan, had it remodeled to house a library in 1897 and it has been used as such ever since. It must be quite a challenge for the Ellsworth Public Library to keep up with the ever-changing needs of their patrons. The Howard County Library Miller Branch was housed in a 1960s building, and they had great trouble fixing the place up to have internet access and adequate wiring for everybody to plug in their laptops and what not. [20130904-162818] [20130904-163020]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Someone told us that the Schoodic Peninsula, the lower end of which is part of Acadia, is really much nicer than Mt. Desert Island, because it&apos;s so much quieter. Hardly anybody goes there, probably because it has far fewer services than the main park, or because they don&apos;t know about it. It really is lovely, and even the drive to get there is along a route marked as \"scenic\" on the Maine tourism map.  [20130904-091917] [20130904-102218]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The first stop of the morning was at the scenic overlook just before you cross over to the Schoodic Peninsula. There&apos;s also a nature preserve a mile or so off Route 1 North, where you have a great view of the rapids. The waters must really be quite treacherous. They didn&apos;t manage to build a permanent bridge until 1926. The one they had some years before that got eaten by termites and washed away by ice floes, and prior to that, everything had to be carried across by ferry. The main product of the area was granite, so that would have been cumbersome, to say the least. [20130904-093916] [20130904-094110] [20130904-094151] [20130904-094842]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the overlook we drove leisurely toward Acadia, stopping along the way to take pictures (across the bay, looking at Mt. Desert Island) and also to buy a souvenir (well, two, actually) at a glass studio that we happened to come across. It&apos;s unusual to find Route 1 designated as a scenic road. Where we live, it&apos;s generally run-down and seedy-looking, despite efforts to improve the Rt. 1 corridor. The owner of the glass studio congratulated us on finding our way to Schoodic and away from the madding crowds and the price gouging (as he saws it) in Bar Harbor and environs. So there you have it. If you ever want to come visit Acadia, you will be much better off staying somewhere on Schoodic. There are plenty of guest houses and things, though no mini golf places and far, far fewer lobster shacks and all the rest of the tourist traps.

It looked like it could have been the setting for \"Murder, She Wrote\" though Wikipedia tells me the outdoor shots for the fictional town of Cabot Cove were all shot in Mendocino, Calif. and not in Maine at all. We decided to drive through the park first, and try and to find a kayaking outfit in Birch Harbor, on the other side. [20130904-105700] [20130904-105718]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But the park was so beautiful that we lingered there for quite a while, and by the time we got to Birch Harbor it was too late to go kayaking. We could have rented a kayak to go out on some nearby lake, but we wanted to go out to sea, and they sensibly don&apos;t allow tourists to do that without a guide. Oh well. The kayak lady was very nice and suggested a cruise boat trip, and we would have gone on that had we been able to find it in Milbridge. But we never did find it, and by then it was after 3 p.m. and it probably would have been too late for a cruise anyway.

They have classes and lectures that are open to the public, but of course we don&apos;t have time to take any of those, even if they happened to be available today. Definitely something to put on our list the next time we visit Maine! It would be worth it just to be able to go into Rockefeller Hall, one of the buildings on campus. Instead we drove a couple of hundred yards further to Schoodic Point, and decided to have a picnic lunch there. It&apos;s not often you come to a place that combines two scents that bring back so many childhood memories: sea, for the beach vacations we used to have when I was a kid, and pine, for the place where my paternal grandparents vacationed, in the middle of a pine forest.

The way people in Maine keep going on and on about lobster, you almost hope one day one of the lobster will grow as monstrously large as that and chase all those lobster trap setting barbarians out of the sea :-) The lobster buoys are colorful, though. I didn&apos;t think we&apos;d find such a redneck lawn decoration in Maine, of all places, but they did at least find a good use for all those ugly colored bathroom fixtures. And what&apos;s up with naming a town T9-SD? Too much Star Wars, d&apos;you think? As it happens, there is still <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/revenue/propertytax/unorganizedterritory/township_map.htm\"> unorganized territory</a> even in Maine.

We tried to get a see kayaking tour for today but that didn&apos;t work out. We did sign up for a tour for tomorrow, but when we looked at the weather forecast for tomorrow, it&apos;s not too good (temperature in the low 60s, fair chance of rain) so we decided to cancel that tour. But we still had to figure out what to do with today. Well, we went to the <em>other</em> Acadia National Park</em>: the one on the next peninsula over, all the way down to Schoodic Point. Far fewer people, and still gorgeous!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-094459] Before we got to the park we stopped at the tidal falls of Taunton Bay, where the water rushing out of the bay creates complete rapids. It didn&apos;t look like much when we were there, since it was almost low tide, but you could still see where the whitewater would be.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-101500] Along the way we came through Sullivan, where we had a great view over Frenchmen Bay of Mount Desert Island, with the various mountains, including the highest, Mount Cadillac.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-104528] In Gouldsboro, we stumbled upon a glass studio where the artist makes different plates with patterns in colored glass. We bought two of these plates to hang on the new wall we&apos;ve built in the living room instead of the handrail. That also takes care of our \"blue glass memento\" for this vacation.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-111615] After all of that, we finally entered into the park. Like its big brother, this part of Acadia has a one-lane road along the coast. Driving along I was reminded time and again of my father, who would have loved the views and the rugged coast here. The photos below don&apos;t really do it justice!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-112107] [20130904-113436] [20130904-113546] [20130904-114839] [20130904-115057]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-121841] At the southern-most point of the road, we reached Schoodic Point. Here you could actually go onto the rocks and people had brought chairs and were enjoying the view. We had our lunch break here while I took photos of the sea clashing into the rocks.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-121340] [20130904-121554] [20130904-121632] [20130904-121744] [20130904-121806] [20130904-123024]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-125810] After our lunch break we drove around some more but not taking a whole lot of pictures.

Nicoline had fajitas and I had a bacon cheeseburger. After dinner we decided to go to the top of Mount Cadillac after all, to see the sunset.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130904-194157] We were really too late to see much of the sunset, which wasn&apos;t a big deal because the summit of the mountain is really much more geared towards watching the sun<em>rise</em>, for which it is of course famous.

Who wants to be out on the water in rain and temperatures in the low 60s? But that meant we had to find some other way of keeping ourselves occupied and reasonably dry.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We decided to go visit the Big Chicken Barn book &amp; antiques store. We&apos;d passed it on our way down to Bar Harbor last Monday, but we wanted to get where we were going, so we hadn&apos;t stopped. There were flyers for the place out in the breakfast area today, so....&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;For those of you unfamiliar with what passes for antiques in these parts: It is what we would charitably call nostalgic, \"uit grootmoeders tijd\" but it&apos;s really junk. They even had a sign up on the door saying: \"No, we won&apos;t buy the junk from your car!\" I expect they&apos;ve been asked that question once too often. Anyway, the antiques store was fun to browse, even if we didn&apos;t actually want to buy anything. Unfortunately, the second hand book store wasn&apos;t much better. Someone had cleaned them out of Agatha Christies :-(&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Still, we passed a rainy morning in relative comfort, and by the time we were through browsing the weather had cleared up, so we drove back down to Bar Harbor and rented bikes for the afternoon with a nod to our Dutch roots. At home I&apos;ve been riding a second-hand bike with a saddle that&apos;s like concrete, against which my behind protests vehemently. The rental came with a \"comfort saddle\" but it&apos;s apparently still not comfy enough for my delicate - though amply padded -  hind parts. Or Eric&apos;s, either. But we biked from Bar Harbor up to Acadia, around Eagle Lake, and back again, which the guy in the rental shop told us was something like 12 miles. So we felt quite accomplished.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We returned the bikes and drove back to the park to visit the Sieur de Monts area of Acadia. Pierre Du Gua de Monts, to give him his full name, was a French explorer and trader who received from king Henry IV of France the right to colonize lands in the Americas. This was not some itty-bitty piece of territory, either. It stretched from what is now Philadelphia to present-day Montreal. Samuel de Champlain acted as his navigator and cartographer. De Monts and his party founded a colony on St. Croix in 1604, but left to find more hospitable climes after the first winter. According to Wikipedia, a Dutch adventurer employed by the West-India Company robbed two of De Monts ships in 1606, but I don&apos;t know how accurate it is. His exploits against French interests in the Americas aren&apos;t mentioned at all in the <a href=\"http://www.oudekerk.nl/graf-van-de-maand/hendrick-cornelisz-lonck-1568-1634.html\"> article </a> that relates his importance in capturing the Spanish silver fleet. Piet Heyn and all that; Dutch readers will understand the reference. But as this Hendrick Corneliszoon Lonck lived from 1568 to 1634, it seems feasible that it&apos;s the same Lonck, although his major exploits against the Spanish took place in the 1620s.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After paying due homage to our French heritage - a heritage we Americans tend to forget or sweep under the carpet, depending on the current state of our diplomatic relations with France - we decided to go back into Bar Harbor to get a bite to eat and turn in early, so we can leave for Calais - Maine, that is - at the crack of dawn.

Because we only had the bikes for four hours, we decided to limit ourselves to a tour around Eagle Lake. We had a light lunch on the way, while taking a break overlooking Breakneck Pond. When we returned the bikes, the guy at the bike shop said that would have been around 12 miles (18km), which isn&apos;t bad.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130905-125701] [20130905-131628] [20130905-132922] [20130905-141313] [20130905-142701]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130905-134813] Of course Nicoline was correct when she warned me that since I hadn&apos;t done any real biking in almost 20 years, it would be harder than I thought.

There may be the occasional hermit by the shore of his/her Walden Pond, but there are no towns and very few roads there. Some are logging roads you can only use by prior permission.

There&apos;s a even a huge boulder near the harbor that marks the spot where they supposedly came ashore. Given that history, we decided to do the Loyalist Walking Tour. I&apos;m not sure exactly what all the sites we saw had to do with loyalists, but it was a lovely tour all the same, not least because the weather was perfect. One was the city market, which is thought to be the oldest common-law market in Canada. Its charter dates back to 1785, but the building that now houses only goes back to 1876. It apparently escaped the great fire of 1877 by virtue of being one of the few stone buildings in the city at that time. Another was the house where Benedict Arnold lived. His way of doing business and his arrogance apparently didn&apos;t go over very well with his fellow townspeople, and at one point they burned him in effigy. Serves him right, too :-) Long story short, Saint John is a lovely city, and we were sorry we only had a few hours there.

There are a few towns along the route, but it really seems very sparsely populated, especially for an area between a busy Atlantic sea port (Saint John is a cruise ship terminal) and the provincial capital Fredericton. We had beautiful river vistas to enjoy, but we needed to be back in Millinocket, Maine, before 8 p.m. so we left the scenic route for  highway #2, the Transcanada Highway. Keep on driving west and you&apos;ll end up on the Pacific Coast in Victoria, British Columbia.

It&apos;s now part of Fredericton, but in the early 19th century it was the site of an apparently famous duel. The cause of the quarrel seems to have been a case of mistaken identity. I thought it was surprising that Canadians, who live in a pretty cold climate, should engage in such a hot-blooded pursuit as dueling. But then again, there was this famous duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804... [20130906-160703]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We stopped for a quick bite at a Tim Horton in Woodstock. Its claim to fame is not the festival, but the fact that it&apos;s the first town in New Brunswick. We crossed back into the U.S. of A. at Houlton, Me., at about 5 p.m. Is it very provincial of me to say that there&apos;s something very comforting about seeing a road sign point to I-95? Unfortunately, the comfort only lasted as long as the actual border crossing. I&apos;m sorry to have to report that the quality of road compared quite unfavorably to that of the Canadian roads we had just traveled on.

But since it is the end (or the start) of the Appalachian Trail, and we&apos;ve been doing day hikes of the same, there&apos;s always that little nugget of a thought: \"Maybe, just maybe....\" Yeah, right. We saw the real thing from a distance, as well as as a scale model in the rangers&apos; office, and it was simply not on the cards. Two-thirds of it is above the treeline! [20130907-104109]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But we did do a hike, and even hiked part of the Appalachian Trail today. The woods were ready for fall, and lovely beyond description, almost like a fairy tale.

But there aren&apos;t any wolves, bad or otherwise, in Baxter. There are black bears, but we didn&apos;t see any. Nor did we see any moose. We saw several squirrels, who are reddish-brown here, as squirrels should be, instead of gray or black as they are in Maryland. They were, however, terribly offended at being interrupted while storing food for winter. They make a noise that&apos;s kind of between a rattle snake&apos;s rattle and a high-pitched bird call. And they would not sit still for a picture, so we looked at mushrooms and moss instead. Mushrooms and moss, because in some cases the moss appeared to grow on or even through the mushroom...

I don&apos;t know anything about lichen, other than that some make pretty patterns on stone, but Eric is standing next to some that almost look like leaves stuck to a rock.  We even found a library in the Daicey Pond campground, and we learned that you can rent a canoe or a kayak on the honor system, $1/hour.

We&apos;ve seen maybe a sixth of the park, which comprises 327.3 sq miles (847.8 kmÂ²). Our hike was around three ponds in the lower left hand corner of the map.

Since the place we are staying does not provide breakfast, we went into town to find a place to have a coffee and something to eat. That wasn&apos;t quite as easy, until we ran into <em>The Appalachian Trail Caf&amp;eacute;</em>. Just what the doctor ordered! It was really busy though, so having breakfast took almost an hour. But after that we were able to buy a detailed map of Baxter State Park in the \"Trail Connection\" shop upstairs.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130907-102459] After breakfast we went to the park. It is half an hour drive from Millinocket to the park visitor center and entrance (if you don&apos;t stop for pictures on the way). We got suggestions from a park ranger and decided to go to the \"Daicey Pond\" area and do some hiking from there on. Since we are planning to come back tomorrow and the day after, we ended up buying a season pass rather than having to pay the entrance fee three times.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130907-110343] Once in the park, it was still a ten-mile drive to Daicey Pond and since this is a gravel road with a speed limit of 20 mph (which is the <em>limit</em>, not the actual speed one can drive, which often was closer to 15 or even 10 mph), it was another 45 minutes until we could park the car and start our hiking.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130907-171721a] The hike we decided to do was not all that hard, but did follow the Appalachian Trail for a part. With us having done the Maryland part of the Appalachian Trail through the Howard County Recreation and Parks day hikes, and since Baxter is the northern end-point of the AT, we couldn&apos;t visit the park and not hike this famous trail. Anyway, we hiked around Daicey Pond and to Elbow Pond and Grassy Pond. It was a beautiful piece of park that we came through, at times it looked like a fairy tale forest. Amazing was the moss, which at times covered whole logs and even complete areas. Also nicely quiet: we only saw other hikers three times on the whole two and a half hour hike. And we saw a lot of different mushrooms.

This morning&apos;s weather wasn&apos;t conducive to hiking, so we staid in bed reading, enjoying our home-made breakfast in bed (bagels). By the time we did get out of bed, we looked at the options and decided on trying the \"River Pond Nature Trail\" because it supposedly included seeing wildlife.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-143249] It took us a while to find it, guessing at the road, but in the end we found the sign to the trail head. A very bumpy, narrow road. A good thing there was no one else hiking this trail!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-131850] The trail itself was interesting, but a bit too long - towards the end we were getting tired of it. The trail was moderately well marked with signs and blue blazes, but it was overgrown in place, plenty of fallen trees to climb over. The following are all photos of the actual trail, not the wild forest:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-114123] [20130908-114659] [20130908-114817] [20130908-123154] [20130908-123321] [20130908-124013] [20130908-131447] [20130908-131553] [20130908-131624] [20130908-135414] [20130908-142446]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-114452] The trail had a number of trees marked with their type, age and use, which was interesting, but beyond that, we didn&apos;t see any wildlife, just some droppings. So after an hour or two we were done with it; unfortunately it took up almost three hours to finish the entire hike.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-152718] After the hike we continued on the \"Golden Road\" to Greenville. The road is marked on the state highway map, but is only moderately better than a logging road. Mostly packed gravel, with lots of potholes, some pretty big. This is how I imagine large parts of Maine, with just some random roads and not much else. The weather was strange, a few rain showers alternating with sun (sometimes at the same time, producing a rainbow). And, we did see some wildlife: a deer.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-144840] [20130908-152108] [20130908-155110] [20130908-160938] [20130908-161420]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130908-171246] By the time we got to Greenville, it was getting later and we decided to have dinner at the \"Black Frog\" restaurant, on the stormy lake. Since we still haven&apos;t seen any moose, Nicoline decided to have a \"Moosehead\" beer, so at least we got to include a picture of a moose in our blog that way! There was a double rainbow in the sky while we were eating. When I looked at the zoomed-in picture of the lower rainbow, I noticed it actually had multiple repetitions of a rainbow in there.

We decided to try an area just south of Baxter State Park, which was listed as having good opportunities for viewing wildlife. [20130908-142839]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We found the River Pond Nature Trail easily enough, and hiked down the trail marked with blue blazes to the edge of a pond said to be frequented by moose. We found their droppings, all right, but no moose. We also saw other droppings that I believe may have been black bear scat. This is definitely bear country, and the last thing you want to do is surprise a bear as s/he is foraging in preparation for hibernation. So I whistled, and banged my hiking pole against any rock I happened to come across, just to give any bears around plenty of warning. It must have worked, because we saw neither bears nor moose. FYI, moose are mostly docile, but can become aggressive when they feel threatened, and you definitely wouldn&apos;t want to be charged by an adult male moose that can weigh upwards of 800 lbs.

I suppose they are made to cater to hikers and do so grudgingly, because trail maintenance definitely seems to be a low priority. Also, Eric and I both have the impression that they marked the trail with as many zigs and zags as they possibly could, out of sheer perversity. \"That&apos;ll teach you tree-hugging idiots to hike on our land!\" But we made it back to the parking lot all right, and looking up at the sky, decided against further hiking expeditions.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Instead we went further down what we think must be some kind of logging road. At least I hope that&apos;s what it is, and not the State of Maine&apos;s idea of proper highway maintenance. To say that it was like a washboard would be to insult the humble household appliance. I&apos;m convinced Kabul has better roads than this! In some places it looked like someone had been shelling it, or else dropping logs on their ends from a great height, causing potholes the size of bath tubs. Oddly enough, in places the potholes were neatly patched, and in other spots the pavement was as smooth as can be. If anyone can explain this, please feel free to do so in the comments.

On more than one occasion I had to drive on the left hand side of the road, which feels so completely wrong it&apos;s hard to describe it. But I wasn&apos;t about to drive through these huge craters. They looked like they might easily swallow a wheel, and how would we get a tow in a place that probably had no cell phone coverage? Better to be careful and arrive with all four wheels still attached.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I&apos;m happy to report that I managed to do so, and we reached the town of Greenville safe and sound, and hungry as bears. We stopped for dinner at the Black Frog at the southern end of Moosehead Lake. Driving down there we saw one warning sign after another about moose crossings. It&apos;s rutting season, or close to it, so if the bulls are anything like deer, which are their first cousins, they pursue any available female ruthlessly and without regard for their personal safety - or ours. [20130908-170416]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Outside of Greenville, and for part of the way back to Millinocket, the same thing. Moose warning signs galore, but no moose in sight. Probably just as well, because you don&apos;t want to see a moose with the nose of your car. We did see some wildlife: a deer, and a group of vultures. But I&apos;m disappointed all the same, especially since the guy in the glass shop on the Schoodic peninsula said we&apos;d be sure to see moose if we went to Moosehead Lake.

No hiking for us today, though: we just stuck with Kidney Pond.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130909-120205] It was a great day to be drifting on the lake.

We also did see the fort in Fort Kent but it was closed so we weren&apos;t able to get in or anything.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130910-093643] [20130910-093825] [20130910-093843] [20130910-110650]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130910-122147] Once we started into Canada, the problems started. First, the Canadian custom officer had a hard time believing we were just driving into his country for a few days without having an idea of where to stay. \"You drove all the way from Maryland to come into Canada\" he asked incredulously. He made us wait for ten minutes or so, probably checking to make sure we didn&apos;t escape from an asylum somewhere, before we could continue.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130910-125734] Then we tried to find a map of where we were going (the province of Quebec). Tourist information: closed. Other tourist information: closed. Library: closed. Gas station: maps were sold out. At least the lady at the gas station was able to point us in the right directions towards the city of Quebec. After just about another hour driving we finally found another gas station (really, we did not see any gas stations or stores or anything like that in the towns we passed through) where we were able to buy a map.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130910-130539] With the map, we at least were able to figure out where we were and where we wanted to go, which was a huge improvement. We found that we could deal with the signs and stuff in French, but understanding the French of the people was very hard. Fortunately is Nicoline better in speaking and understanding French then I am, so I&apos;m mostly letting her do the talking now.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130910-160708] Around four o&apos;clock we were getting pretty close to Quebec and since we wanted a hotel/motel outside of the town, we started looking. We basically followed a sign we saw on the highway to Motel Beaumont, and it turned out to have really nice rooms! So we unpacked and rested for a moment, then went out to get some groceries for breakfast tomorrow (breakfast is not included) and went to eat before getting back to the motel to do our trip diary.&lf;&nl;','2013-09-11 00:13:38','D','2013-09-11 00:13:38','N'),('2013-maine','20130910D0002','nicoline','20130910','Into Quebec','An adventurous day for two suburbanites. We drove north on Maine highway 11 because that&apos;s how you get to the end of Route 1 on the Fort Kent bridge. Unfortunately, the bridge is undergoing major maintenance and the sign was nowhere to be seen. Also, the Canadian border inspection guys found us suspicious enough that they made us park and wait for them to do an additional inspection. In the end it amounted to precisely nothing, because we really are who we are, but it was an unsettling experience. [20130910-112640] [20130910-112806]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then we drove into New Brunswick, where the tourist information office was closed and no one anywhere had any maps of the area for sale. We couldn&apos;t find the New Brunswick map we picked up the last time we went into Canada, and we had been stupid enough to leave the Canadian maps that I got from Freecycle sitting at home instead of packing them with the rest of the stuff. Served us right, I guess. Not knowing much of anything about Canada we thought that only Quebeqois had that separatist streak, but it seems there&apos;s a wedge of New Brunswick west of Edmunston where people apparently believe they are French before they are anything else. Everything is in French, many houses fly the French flag, and everybody speaks French, too. [20130910-125734] [20130910-152456]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We did the best we could with what little French we still have from way back when, and finally managed to buy a map of the province of Quebec, so we&apos;d at least know in what general direction we should be heading. My French had recovered sufficiently that I was able to ask the lady at the gas station if the white curly thingies were what people put on poutine. She answered in the affirmative, and I bought a small baggie of cheese curds, which squeak between your teeth when you eat them, but they&apos;re not bad. And then we drove and drove, and drove some more, until at last even we got tired of it. Then we switched to the highway and took an exit that had a promising sign for a motel 3 km down the road. I managed to get a room for us in my best French, and we were very pleasantly surprised to see not just a hotel room but really more of an efficiency apartment, complete with kitchen. [20130910-153237] [20130910-155608] [20130910-160620]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So we plunked down our stuff, took half an hour to check facebook and email, and headed into town to find a supermarket to buy breakfast stuff and get some dinner. We found a supermarket easily enough, but dinner was a little more difficult. We criss-crossed le vieux carrÃ© de LÃ©vis, but couldn&apos;t find any restaurants whatever, other than the chain restaurant places up on the highway. But at last we managed to find our way back to the highway quite by accident, and ended up having dinner at a Normandin restaurant. They had a special going, patÃ© a l&apos;oie, which looked enticing, so I tried that. It was pretty good, even if I didn&apos;t know what an \"oie\" was until was back at the motel where I could google it. In case you&apos;re wondering, it&apos;s goose.&lf;&nl;','2013-09-11 00:36:30','D','2013-09-11 00:32:09','N'),('2013-maine','20130911D0001','nicoline','20130911','Quebec','People in QuÃ©bec probably don&apos;t need to do the stairmaster machine at their gym. Good grief. The whole city seems to be one big staircase, and if you&apos;re not walking stairs, you&apos;re on an incline. I wonder what they do if they have an ice storm. Those stone steps and steep sidewalks will become positively lethal. [20130911-140140] [20130911-143437]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;However, today just started with fog and drizzle, which didn&apos;t bode well to our uninitiated eyes, but we soon found out that it was actually a bit on the warm side for getting such a cardio workout. Because we&apos;d ended up in LÃ©vis yesterday, which is across the St. Lawrence River from la vieille citÃ© QuÃ©bec, and we had happened to notice signs pointing to a ferry, we took said ferry across this morning. [20130911-093744] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-144252]QuÃ©bec is a very European-looking city, up to and including the fact that they don&apos;t seem to make any attempt to exclude car traffic from the old town, in which the streets are scarcely wider than streets in medieval Flemish and Dutch towns of our acquaintance. The French also didn&apos;t believe in laying out cities on a grid, so the streets are charmingly winding. It&apos;s easy to lose your way, but the old city isn&apos;t so big that that&apos;s a terrible problem. [20130911-181019] [20130911-113617] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The ferry docked at what is known as the lower town, and the first thing we noticed was that they have an incline (funiculaire) similar to the one we rode in Pittsburgh last year. Of course, we need the exercise, so we disdained the incline and instead walked up I don&apos;t know how many steps to Dufferin Terrace in the upper town. Contrary to our earlier experience in QuÃ©bec (the province), tourist information was easy to find, very helpful, and blessedly bilingual. [20130911-094857] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I really did make an effort to speak French, but it was early in the morning and explaining that we wanted to do a self-guided walking tour of the old city is beyond my linguistic ability. At any rate, they gave us a booklet and a map, and we set out on a walk around town. We wanted to see the sound &amp; light show of the military history of QuÃ©bec at the MusÃ©e du Fort, but the English language show wouldn&apos;t start until about 45 minutes after we got there, so we decided to do part of the walking tour first and come back for the show later. [20130911-100953] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Having read Fred Anderson&apos;s magnum opus \"Crucible of War. The Seven Years&apos; War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766\" after our trip down Braddock Road to Fort Necessity, and Pittsburgh last year I had a passing acquaintance with the way in which Canada came to be British instead of French. But I believe it takes a peculiar mindset for a country that has been beaten out of continent to choose to house its consulate in the very mansion where the surrender of the French was signed in 1759. It reminds me of a rather cruel World War II era joke: \"How many divisions does it take to defend Paris?\" Answer: \"Nobody knows, it&apos;s never been tried.\" I also noticed that, while QuÃ©bec is very proudly French, I did not see any French cars in the city. Plenty of American, Japanese, Korean and German ones, but not one Peugot, Renault, or Citroen. And what&apos;s up with calling a territory Nouvelle France, but naming pretty much every town and every street after some saint or other? Apart from Orleans, there aren&apos;t any French towns worthy of being called Nouvelle (or Noveau, I suppose) something-or-other? [20130911-103228] [20130911-103325]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We had got as far as the Anglican cathedral of the Holy Trinity, where the panels commemorating the British and Commonwealth war death listed more QuÃ©beqois who died in World War I than in World War II, when it was time to go back to the museum for the sound &amp; light show. The cathedral also has a special seat in the balcony that&apos;s reserved for the reigning monarch, and it features a piece from the bombed-out ruins of St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral in London, which is somewhat odd, given that the guide book mentioned that the cathedral was modeled after St. Martin-in-the-Fields. [20130911-105355] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The show at the museum was actually pretty well done. They had a scale model of the city and the rivers (St. Lawrence to the south and St. John to the north) that surround it, and little ships and buildings and regiments and things that lit up to illustrate what the narrator was saying, and lines of lights that showed whose troops marched where and so on. General Wolfe&apos;s attack on the city in 1759 succeeded because he realized he could not overcome its seaward defenses - though he tried - so he decided to attack from the landward side, even though that involved breaching the city wall. Back in those days, even soldiers were bilingual in English and French and when a guard challenged the redcoats (or the American irregulars that were part of Wolfe&apos;s forces) he answered in such fluent French that it quelled suspicion. War isn&apos;t just about who has the larger army or the niftiest weaponry, eh? Because it was still foggy and drizzly, we decided not to walk out onto the Plains of Abraham, where the 1759 battle was fought, but instead limited ourselves to a tour of the citadel. It wasn&apos;t part of the original fortifications, as it only dates back to the 1820s, and then walked back to the Rue d&apos;Auteuil, where there&apos;s a monument to two conferences between Churchill and Roosevelt in 1943 and 1944. There&apos;s also a monument to Canadians who fought in the Second Boer War (1899-1902). [20130911-110337] [20130911-114643] [20130911-121037] [20130911-123643] [20130911-123705]  [20130911-122537]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From there we went on to rather more peaceful pursuits, such as perusing a store full of Crocs. The kids will no doubt be thoroughly disgusted, but I am all about comfortable shoes, and whatever else you can say about Crocs, they *are* comfortable. Or a visit to a store called Les DÃ©lices de l&apos;Erable, losely translated as Maple Delicacies. We had passed several signs of people advertising their skills as Ã©rabliÃ¨res, and I had absolutely no idea what that could possibly be. They&apos;re producers of maple syrup. I never did find out what dÃ©panneurs were, though, until I looked it up just now. It comes from the verb dÃ©panner, meaning \"to help out of difficulty\" or \"to troubleshoot,\" but what it really is is a convenience store. Who knew. [20130911-131723] [20130911-131810]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As it happened, we were in need of a dÃ©panneur by then, because it had stopped drizzling and started to pour, so we ducked into a coffee place on the Place de l&apos;HÃ´tel de Ville, where we treated ourselves to a cappucino with a meringue for Eric and and a gateau au Ã©rable for me. It was very good. From there we went on through the little park opposite city hall, which has a statue of the first Canadian cardinal and is directly across from the Notre-Dame de QuÃ©bec Basilica-Cathedral, which is a very beautiful church. We were in luck, because someone was playing the organ, and there&apos;s nothing quite like organ music played on a church organ. [20130911-134551] [20130911-141337] [20130911-141437] [20130911-142017]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Basilica-Cathedral there were two more stops on the walking tour, but they didn&apos;t seem that interesting to us, so we just stopped to buy some post cards and mailed them at Post Canada around the corner, then walked down the Rue de Remparts down to the lower city, where we came across a kitchen whole sale store which happened to have red serving trays! Yay! I&apos;d been searching high and low for one, and I hadn&apos;t been able to find one. A somewhat utilitarian memento of QuÃ©bec, I suppose, but it will be put to good use (by our cat Cleopatra). [20130911-143437] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;For some reason, the lower city has an entirely different feel to it than the upper city. Probably because most of its buildings are older. Or perhaps it&apos;s because it&apos;s not quite so touristy as the upper city. At any rate, it was lovely to walk around in. There was a plaque commemorating the landing of 65 Filles de Roy, who had been especially selected by the crown and given a dowry for the express purpose of landing a husband in Nouvelle France. There was no shortage of men wanting to marry them: Some 700 colonials applied to take one of the king&apos;s daughters as his bride. I don&apos;t know how they settled the matter, seeing as there were more than 10 men for every girl. But the ploy served its purpose: The colony&apos;s population tripled in the space of a few years. [20130911-143437] [20130911-160554] [20130911-161023] [20130911-161415]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By now we were tired and hungry, and within sight of the ferry building, so we plonked ourselves down at a Beaver Tails (Queque de Castor) establishment, where Eric tried a #3 queque de castor au Ã©rable and I finally got to eat poutine. It was actually pretty good, but so much I couldn&apos;t finish it all, so Eric ended up finishing it. He liked it, too. We treated ourselves to a small maple-walnut ice cream and walked back to the ferry. Back at the motel, I spent most of the evening writing up this account of today&apos;s events with my feet up on a chair, because they feel about ready to fall off.

So we don&apos;t have to drive into the city, we can park on this side of the river and take the ferry in. And if it hadn&apos;t been so foggy, we would have had a great view of the old city coming in. As it was, we saw mostly fog.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-093523] [20130911-093612] [20130911-093852]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-100555] Once on the other side of the river, we climbed the many stairs to the old town on top of the cliffs to find the tourist information. At the tourist information, we got a map of the city and a booklet that had a number of walking tours. We chose to follow the one \"Inside the walls\" which took us around the fortified upper part of the city.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-133442] For much of the day the weather remained foggy, drizzling, and we got caught in one shower (from which we found shelter in a coffee shop, where we had a cup of coffee and a snack). Only later in the afternoon did it begin to clear up a little bit.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-133657] [20130911-134245] [20130911-134551]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-130837] We saw a lot of the old town, with one of the most interesting parts the library in the Morrin building. This is the kind of library I would aspire to, if I had the money -- including the gallery and the round staircase on the left. Also notice the radiators, which are basically stacks of iron pipes through which I guess the hot water runs.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-141337] When we got out of the Notre-Dame-de-Qu&amp;eacute;bec cathedral (which really is beautiful inside) there finally was some sun and some blue sky. We finished the walking tour of the walled city and decided to head down to the \"lower\" part of town, next to the river.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20130911-160938] Here we walked around until it was time for dinner. Nicoline got the \"poutine\" she had been looking forward to and I had a \"beaver tail\" with maple syrup frosting.

Then we went to Woodstock, just to see what it was like, and sent some people we think will appreciate it a Woodstock-ish postcard. There really wasn&apos;t that much to see, though, apart from the \"historical\" markers Eric especially wanted to see, so we continued on to Hyde Park, FDR&apos;s home on the Hudson. We got there about 11.45 and didn&apos;t leave until nearly 3 p.m. But there was a lot to see there. For starters, there are the grounds. By the time of Roosevelt&apos;s death the estate was about 1,500 acres. We didn&apos;t walk around all 1,500 acres of course, but just getting from the visitor center to the house and from there to the library involves a fair bit of walking.

So they enlarged the house by adding two wings, which brought the total number of rooms up to 35. Some of these rooms have been used, not only by Sara Delano (FDR&apos;s mother, who inherited the place when her husband died), FDR, Eleanor and their kids, but also a host of guests .The Roosevelts apparently also hosted George VI of England, and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall - though not at the same time, I would image - Winston Churchill and Queen Elizabeth, as well as countless politicos from the time he was a New York state senator, an under-secretary of the navy, governor of New York, and finally President. The house was never modified to accommodate FDR&apos;s disability from when he contracted polio, though a trunk lift, which was used to lift heavy steamer trunks to the second floor, was minimally adapted so that his wheelchair (made from a kitchen chair, otherwise it wouldn&apos;t fit in the narrow corridor) would fit into it.

The earliest Roosevelt to settle in New York, which was then still New Amsterdam, came in 1649. The Dutch West India Company had been set up in 1621, partly to help protect the fur trade in the Hudson Valley, and partly because the West Indies were conducive to growing sugar cane. Later on the family branched out into railways and all kinds of other business interests, but they really got their start in a business that relied heavily on the use of slaves. Which makes it more than a little ironic that Eleanor Roosevelt was such a civil rights activist.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;She truly was an activist, not just for civil rights, but also for the right of women to equal pay for equal work and subsidized child care for working mothers (which we had for a while, during WW II), but also for civil liberties. She criticized President Truman for instituting a loyalty program  for federal employees in 1947, which allowed the FBI to investigate the political convictions of thousands of federal workers. The FBI apparently considered her a dangerous person, because her file is several thousand pages long. The Ku Klux Klan put a price on her head when she went to Tennessee in 1957  to speak to a gathering of people working for racial integration. The local sheriff was a klansman, so her safety was far from guaranteed, but she went anyway. She did, however, obtain a gun permit, and, presumably, a gun. Eleanor lived to tell about her trip down South, though. She died in 1962. Both she and FDR are buried at Springwood, in front of a surprisingly modest grave monument. The one with the American flag is FDR&apos;s.

Unfortunately, we caught yet another downpour, and there had also been an accident involving a schoolbus on the narrow two-lane road that runs along the Hudson River. Incidentally, you can barely see the river for most of the way down. It wasn&apos;t until after West Point that it became visible in place, and even then the Empire State puts parking spots in precisely those areas where the view is obscured by trees. Go figure. All in all, we got to the West Point visitor center just as it was closing, so we could only take a look at the exhibits they have there without being able to go into the museum. And since they&apos;re having a home football game tomorrow, there won&apos;t be any tours tomorrow, either, so it would be useless to stay in the West Point area overnight.

Odd how we recognized hardly anything anymore. Or maybe not so odd, since it&apos;s been over 16 years since we lived there. Both Eric and I were amazed to see how far the playground in Millburn was from our house. We sometimes walked there with the neighbors, observant Jews who couldn&apos;t drive on Saturdays, and whose kids were a little older than ours. Frank and Mark would walk there, play, and walk back without a problem, but it really seemed quite a hike when we drove the distance today. We also took a little tour around South Mountain elementary in Millburn, which was home to a preschool that Frank and Mark attended at the time. It seems to have been converted back to its original purpose since. Then we drove back to Short Hills, through the street where Mark spoke the immortal words: \"But mommy, my noggin is full of talk!\" when I asked him to be quiet so I could hear the news.

The grocery store where I used to shop was also still there. Then we took the exit to get back on the highway and onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Some heavy traffic due to construction on the way, but otherwise quite uneventful. We were home by 1.30 p.m. and I went inside to pet the cats and assure them that we had really come home, while Eric unloaded the car. Then Eric sat down to process pictures and what not while I unpacked, sorted laundry, fed the cats (not that they hadn&apos;t been fed, but just to show everything was back to normal), and took a shower.

Most to the U.S. but also to Canada and Australia. The monument wasn&apos;t dedicated until 1999. I expect they had more pressing concerns than monuments before that.

The way the introductory exhibit is laid out,  it&apos;s really hard to see all panels without getting in front of people,  and when we got to the room where they keep the real thing in a glass case, there was such a crowd you could barely catch a glimpse of it. The exhibit upstairs, about an early Irish king, Brian Boru, was interesting. Medieval history isn&apos;t my forte and I had always thought he was a mythical figure, like king Arthur. He died in battle at Clontarf at the beginning of the 11th century. The library that houses the Book of Kells and the Brian Boru exhibit was well worth seeing itself.

They have a bike rental service similar to the one in New York City or Washington, D.C. and contrary to what I expected, the terrain doesn&apos;t seem to be very hilly (although looks can be deceiving). But after two days in Ireland I keep catching myself looking the wrong way before crossing or waiting for the bus. It&apos;s probably safer for us (and the people of Dublin) to stick with walking, and wait for the pedestrian light to turn green, even if the signal for the blind sounds as though something is malfunctioning. [20140908-171359]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We walked back into town this morning to catch the tour bus to Kilmainham Gaoll, a prison that housed most of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising before their execution. Although hanging seems to have been the method of choice for the execution of \"common\" criminals, the leaders of the Easter Rising were executed by firing squad, with one of them so badly injured in the fighting that he had to be strapped to a chair. [20140908-124406] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Although the government may have tried to reform the prison to make it more humane by implementing some of Jeremy Bentham&apos;s ideas, it must have been a kind of hell on earth, particularly during the years of the famine (ca. 1845-52). The prison was supposed to house about 200 inmate, but at one point people became so desperate that they committed crimes with the intent of being thrown into jail so they would at least have something to eat, and the inmate population rose to over 9,000. The government&apos;s solution was to reduce prison rations, while continuing food exports (grain etc.) Convicts were also transported (i.e. deported) to penal colonies overseas. Great are the uses of empire. [20140908-124512] [20140908-130006] [20140908-132529]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Surprisingly, the prison did have two chapels, one protestant and one catholic. I wouldn&apos;t have put it past the English to make prisoners attend Anglican services, just because they could. Still, the Irish had ample reason to hate the English, and had in fact been agitating for Home Rule since Charles Parnell was elected to the House of Commons in 1875. By 1914 the issue had become so fraught politically that some believed Britain to be on the verge of civil war, from which only the outbreak of World War I \"saved\" them. Promises of home rule after the war in exchange for help against the Kaiser didn&apos;t stop nationalists from trying to force the issue by means of the 1916 revolt. However, it lacked public support and fizzled after a few days of savage fighting. Some of the pictures we saw today could easily pass for pictures of towns like Ypres  or Reims, which gives you some indication of the pitched battles fought in and around the General Post Office on O&apos;Connell street. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After touring the jail and the museum we decided to enjoy the beautiful weather in Phoenix Park. The park is home to what used to be the viceregal mansion and is now the official residence of the Irish president. In 1882, Irish nationalists murdered the newly appointed viceroy, Lord Cavendish, on his very first day in the country. The murderers were hanged at Kilmainham, but the prison museum had no information about them whatever. So we walked about the park none the wiser in that respect, but it was pleasant all the same. [20140908-135101] [20140908-135852]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the park we rode the bus back into the city to buy postcards for the express purpose of mailing them from the O&apos;Connell street post office. In the entrance, a plaque commemorates Patrick Pearse&apos;s reading of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic in 1916. I couldn&apos;t swear that the holes in the wall we saw were actually made by bullets, but a nearby memorial clearly does have bullet holes in it.

It is no small irony that we come across the Famine Memorial. This memorial remembers the Great Famine from 1845 to 1852, in which a million Irish died and another million emigrated. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140909-110125] [20140909-111112] [20140909-112221]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140909-113137]We walk past the Jacobs Inn, the hostel where we will be staying after our hike on the Wicklow Way and before taking the ferry to England.

We continue a little bit further until O&apos;Connell Street, where we cross the Liffey again and head to Trinity College.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140909-115851] Trinity College in Dublin of course has a lot of reason for fame. What strikes me most is in how many places old buildings seem to have been replaced by new ones, even in such a historic area as Trinity College. It actually reminds us of Howard Community College!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140909-122826] What we really come for is the library, which houses the Book of Kells. They make a big thing of exhibiting this book, and it is definitely a beautiful work. But the display is crowded and the exhibition that leads up to it is confusing. But the library! You leave the Book of Kells display through the Trinity College library, and that is an amazing place! We sit on one of the benches and just look around for ten minutes.

We figured that in September the biggest crowds would be gone, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case at all. Anyway, we end up at St. Patrick Cathedral, where we sit in the park and enjoy an ice cream snack. We don&apos;t go into the cathedral itself, as it charges a fee.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140909-134607] [20140909-142124] [20140909-140244] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140909-150647] Next we visit the \"Dublinia\" exhibition, which shows Dublin during the Viking times and the middle ages.

We also get a phone (which should have signal along most of the route) and other information.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140910-121414] Enniskerry is a little village that started out as a place for the personnel of the Powerscourt estate.

First we went up the trail to the Bog Meadow and the Knocksink Wood Nature Reserve. The entrance to the Bog Meadow sports fields had a height limit of 1.90m, so I was only just OK with my 1.86m length.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140910-122513] [20140910-122827] [20140910-124949] [20140910-130255] [20140910-134940]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140910-144912] After nature reserve, we hiked the other way to the Powerscourt estate, now a hotel. The view on the way up was spectacular! We did not visit its famous gardens, but instead had a cup of tea in its fancy restaurant. We felt distinctly under-dressed, in our hiking outfits, but fortunately Marching Monkey stole the show, with two of the waiters commenting on how cute he was!

In fact, the entire town was built just to accommodate the servants close by but out of sight. They were all Catholics, who didn&apos;t even have their own church, but had to worship in a barn until a mid-19th century viscount was kind enough to give them a proper church. Even the police (garda) station is housed in what used to be a Royal Irish Constabulary barracks. [20140910-141343]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The manor is now a luxury hotel &amp; spa,  with its own golf course next door, and we were actually a bit embarrassed, since we were dressed for hiking rather than a fancy afternoon tea, but we decided to go for it anyway.

As it happened,  our trusty Marching Monkey sat right on the table and was a great ice breaker, with waiters and waitresses coming over to pet him and tell us how cute he was.

The food was excellent! We speculated as to what could have brought an Italian to begin a restaurant in Enniskerry of all places, but couldn&apos;t think of a tactful way of bringing up the subject. My favorite is that the owner may be from the southern Italy and wanted to escape poverty,  though if I&apos;d asked, he&apos;d probably have turned out to be from Turin and just didn&apos;t fancy going to work for Fiat :-) [20140910-175658][20140910-184424]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Eric took pictures, of course, and the owner of the restaurant said, half jokingly, that if we really liked it, we should post pics to the restaurant&apos;s facebook page, and Eric went and did just that.

Sometimes wide but mostly narrow paths, going up and down steep hills, over styles and through fields. We pass forests (where the forrest floor is all green, covered in moss) and clear-cut areas. By this time, my feet are killing me, I have to step carefully to make sure I don&apos;t fall, and I&apos;m really ready to be done.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140911-145759] [20140911-145850] [20140911-145926] [20140911-150146] [20140911-150639] [20140911-151715] [20140911-152824] [20140911-155340] [20140911-155405]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140911-164347] By four thirty we finally reach the Wicklow Way Lodge, the bed and breakfast where we will be spending the night.

Of course, the hike was \"only\" 10 km (just over 6 miles), so it was half the distance we did yesterday. Also, it was not as much up-and-down, although there were still a couple of decent climbs and descends in there.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-104625] We picked up the Wicklow Way right outside of the B&amp;B where we were staying. It was foggy when we got up, got even more foggy over breakfast, but started to clear when, by 10:30, we finally got on our way. The first two kilometers were along the road and it was yet another reminder why Ireland (like the South of England) is not a great area for a vacation by car: many of the country roads are sunken into the landscape, so if you&apos;re in a car it feels like driving through a green tunnel. Which gets boring pretty quickly.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-105905] Soon enough we turned into a gravel farm road, and started going over styles and stuff. These roads give a much better view of the surroundings. One farmer even providing a tap with drinking water for hikers. This is something we should have had yesterday, when we were severely limiting the amount of water we could drink (we should have taken at least another 2 liters).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-105537] [20140912-110633] [20140912-110555] [20140912-111146]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-111514] There were two groups of other hikers we kept running into. One, a boy and girl who sounded as if they came from Germany, kept passing us, then we would pass them when they&apos;d be resting. They first passed us less than 10 minutes into the hike and we arrived at Glendalough almost at the  same time. The other, a group of four who seemed to speak French, seemed to be sitting next to the road every half hour or so, but we didn&apos;t see them anymore after lunch. It was good to see, though, that us old people more or less took the same time hiking this trail as the young ones did.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-114523] The hike turned through fields of heather again, and fields of ferns - some of it turning a golden brown color. Every couple of hundred yards the view would change so we never had much of a chance to get bored. We also passed one of the shelters that can be found along the trail, much like the Appalachian Trail shelters. And Marching Monkey remains our faithful travel companion.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-112007] [20140912-113944] [20140912-113955] [20140912-112537] [20140912-112646] [20140912-113209] [20140912-113614]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-121610] Lunch consists of sandwiches, an apple, and a fruit juice, packed by the lady of the Bed and Breakfast.

We still have a 1.2 km hike up to the Bed and Breakfast where we will be staying, and before that we want to see Glendalough itself. There is a large parking lot with many tour buses and people around us speak German, French, and other languages. Glendalough is a famous tourist spot because of its ruins of a medieval monastery.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-141917] In the visitor center, they were running the German version of the presentation when we arrived, so we watched that one rather than wait for the English one. And I&apos;m pleased to say that I had barely any trouble following it! After reviewing the exhibits, including a model of what the monastery had looked like, we went out to look at the real thing. It seems that much of the former monastery area has been taken over by a grave yard, there are grave markers by and between all the ruins.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-143156] [20140912-143659] [20140912-143716] [20140912-144356] [20140912-143819] [20140912-144833]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140912-151240] Now we continue to the Riversdale House B&amp;B, which is reached through a series of stepping stones to cross the river. Here we take a shower and rest, before arranging for a courtesy pickup by the Wicklow Heather, a restaurant back in Laragh (the village where we had lunch).

In fairness to the youngsters, though, most of them were backpackers carrying tents and all kinds of camping accouterments, while we only carry day packs and have a proper bed and other creature comforts waiting for us at the end of the day. I wonder if this trip signifies that we are well on our way to becoming \"oudere jongeren\"? You know, the kind of \"matured youngsters\" who desperately cling to the stuff they did when they were young in a doomed effort to stave off old age. [20140912-111514] [20140912-112646]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At any rate, we walked our second section of the Wicklow Way today. It was almost a rest day, just 10 km (6.2 miles), again in gorgeous weather and a spectacularly beautiful countryside. I&apos;d managed to get a slight sunburn yesterday, so I doused myself in sunscreen and wore a hat most of the day. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There&apos;s not much to say about the hike itself that the pictures don&apos;t convey much better, so I&apos;ll let them do the talking.

They&apos;re actually from county Donegal, in the northwest of Ireland, instead of county Wicklow, but that&apos;s okay, since the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/09/a2059409.shtml\">Donegal corridor was an Allied lifeline during World War II</a>. The new Irish republic absolutely refused to join the Brits in their fight against the Nazis, but they didn&apos;t quite slam the door on Allied war effort by letting American pilots fly in from the Atlantic over Irish territory in order to have a straight route into Ulster, which was (and is) part of the United Kingdom. I&apos;ve decided that my county Donegal socks make up for missing out on the <a href=\"http://www.glencree.ie/\">Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation</a>,  which includes a German war cemetery with graves from both world wars, but which turned out to be too far off the trail to include in this trip. Maybe next time :-)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Glendalough is not only famous for its two mountain lakes,  but also for being the site of a 6th century monastery, the remains of which are open to the public. There&apos;s also a modern visitors center where we watch a short documentary about early Christian Ireland in general and Glendalough in particular. In German, because a tour bus full of German tourists had just arrived, and we didn&apos;t feel like waiting for the English language version. I&apos;m pleased to report that neither of us had trouble understanding the German, even if we&apos;re badly out of practice speaking it. Or I am, at least.

Most of the gravestones were very old and faded, but I found at least two from last year. Seeing it&apos;s already September, there are probably one or two newer ones as well. However, I&apos;m happy to report that the newer the gravestone,  the more likely it is that the person who lies beneath it died in his or her eighties or nineties, instead of forties and fifties for the 19th century ones and sixties and seventies for 20th century graves. Of course one must always have terrible souvenir stalls. They even sold Mickey and Minnie Mouse dolls, for unfathomable reasons, and greasy spoons, but the monastic site is worth visiting all the same. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the cemetery it was another kilometer or two to the B&amp;B, and Wonderful Ireland&apos;s instructions explicitly said that we were to cross the river by way of stepping stones. That sort of thing offends my Teutonic sense of order. To quote our instructions: \"Very rarely the river may be swollen and it may not be possible to cross over. In this case please phone the guesthouse at [phone number] and they can come and collect you.\" Seriously, you get enough people that you can earn a living operating a B&amp;B, but you can&apos;t figure out it might actually be helpful to build a bridge?

But since we&apos;re booked into the Stirabout Lane B&amp;B in Rathdrum, about 10 miles away, which is also where we&apos;ll be catching the train back to Dublin, it would involve having someone drive us back to Glenmalure, and pick us up again to take us back to Rathdrum.

Barely three minutes&apos; walk from Connolly Station, where we arrived, and also very close to the bus station. While I did the laundry, Eric figured out which bus to take to the ferry terminal tomorrow, and went to pick up our ferry and train tickets for tomorrow&apos;s journey.

It&apos;s actually dedicated to all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom. I don&apos;t know what the exact numbers are, but you come across plaques like the one we saw in Rathdrum in many places. There was also one right on the corner of Pearse Street, where Padraic Pearse surrendered to the British in 1916. For all their public school spirit, the English really conducted a reign of terror in Ireland for centuries. There&apos;s clearly a reason there is not the slightest chance of forming a union of the British isles. Instead they seem bent on balkanization.

There was only an overhead light fixture in the room, no bedside tables with lamps or anything like that. And since the bed was a bunk bed with a double below and a single on top, the mattress on the top one blocked much of the light. But Eric soon fixed that. How&apos;s that for a convertible bed, eh?

Well, it never does to tell Eric such things jokingly, because we did end up going there. Even Marching Monkey expressed his disapproval of a dissolution of the 300+ year Anglo-Scottish union.

The sea was calm and the Jonathan Swift hydrofoil or catamaran or whatever it was took barely two hours to get to Holyhead. The Virgin (as in Richard Branson) train was on time and we arrived at Euston station after a journey that took us down the length of Wales, and we passed the station with the world&apos;s longest name. Must be fun if you have to fill out forms there. Eric hunted down an ATM and figured out where to get a rechargable fare card for the tube (it actually works for London buses as well, which is brilliant), and we arrived at The Oval (yes, the famous cricket field) without any trouble.

One thing led to another, and we made it as far into the city as Trafalgar Square and the London Eye. It happened to be Battle of Britain day, so it was highly appropriate that we came across the monument that bears Sir Winston Churchill&apos;s famous words: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\" [20140915-171103] [20140915-171842] [20140915-172308] [20140915-172828] [20140915-173715] [20140915-173726] [20140915-173756] [20140915-175050] [20140915-175334] [20140915-175349] [20140915-175732] [20140915-180347] [20140915-180749] [20140915-180824] [20140915-180910] [20140915-180952] [20140915-181807] [20140915-192917] [20140915-193239] [20140915-194711]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We walked back to Lambeth by way of the south bank of the Thames, and we began to realize just how far we had really walked.

This gave Marching Monkey a whole bed of his own at the top, but it also meant that I couldn&apos;t read my book, because there was no light on my side of the bottom bed. Well, there was something to be done about that&amp;mdash;I \"opened the roof\" by sliding the top mattress away. Worked perfectly, and Marching Monkey didn&apos;t mind!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140915-071026] We had to get up early this morning to catch the 7:15 express bus to the ferry terminal. We did have a few moments to check email in the lobby (there is no WiFi in the room, just in the lobby of the hostel) and I received an email from our host for tonight, confirming that we can come straight to the apartment and don&apos;t have to pick up the keys elsewhere first. That&apos;s a lot more convenient with the two large suitcases we&apos;re lugging around. We were of course plenty on time at the bus stop, and could see the sky over Dublin starting to color with sunrise.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There is not a whole lot to say about the ferry and train trip. I spend a lot of the time restoring the local photo archive; somehow, the hard drive of the laptop managed to get corrupt and the Windows restore function lost a bunch of the photos. I&apos;ve learned a while ago not to take the photos off of the cards until I have another backup, so I was able to go back to the cards and copy them to the laptop again.

So we don&apos;t have much of a map of our travels today, just a couple of straight lines.

Nicoline particularly wanted to see the part on WW-I. But we look through some of the other parts as well. Interesting things like the individual bomb shelter from WW-II, or the Smith gun, which would be rolled to the desired place, put on its side, and then the bottom wheel would be come the platform on which it rotates and the top wheel would provide some shelter.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-105018] [20140916-105047] [20140916-111423] [20140916-111728] [20140916-112640]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The entrance to the World War I exhibition was through a timed ticket (although still free), presumably because there is a lot of interest in that exhibition this year. Some of the posters from around the British empire, encouraging people to join the army, and one from just after the sinking of the Lusitania, showing a mother with a baby in her arms sinking to the bottom of the sea. And a copy of the Zimmermann Telegram.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-114232] [20140916-114247] [20140916-122331] [20140916-122238]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-131623] We spend two and a half hours in the museum before we have enough and emerge onto the streets again. We find an ATM (called \"bank machine\" here) and a convenience store where we get some sandwiches for lunch, then walk on to the London Bridge. It is nice weather (21 degrees centigrade, low seventies) so it&apos;s not so much of a chore to walk the mile or so.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-131907] [20140916-132143] [20140916-132559] [20140916-132843] [20140916-133647] [20140916-134336]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-141731] Like probably so many tourists, we confuse the London Bridge with the Tower Bridge.

When I hear \"Tower of London\" I&apos;ve always seen in my mind the image of the Tower Bridge. Anyone who&apos;s been to London knows that this is totally wrong: the Tower of London is actually a complete castle (and functioning royal palace) located in the neighborhood of the Tower Bridge, but quite separate. This photo is of the whole Tower complex, with the City of London behind it.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-145603] Fortunately there is no limit to the number of people they admit, so even though it&apos;s already close to three in the afternoon, we get tickets and line up for the one-hour walking tour. Thank you to Andrea for recommending this!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140916-144913] As a remembrance of the first World War, there are almost a million ceramic poppies placed in what used to be the moat of the Tower.

We hadn&apos;t yet booked tickets for the London Eye yet, for example, because we didn&apos;t want to run the risk of going up in that thing when it rains. When we went to the website, it said people need to book at least 24 hours in advance to get the discount, so we booked it for tomorrow. Incredible as it may seem, the weather here is just as gorgeous as it was in Ireland. [20140916-101252] [20140916-101511]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Instead of going to the Eye we went first to the Imperial War Museum (IWM), which is having a special World War I exhibition. The first thing we saw as we walked up to the entrance was a pair of huge 15\" naval guns, which had seen action on D-Day and in the southwest of The Netherlands in October 1944, when the Allies bombarded the dikes surrounding Walcheren in order to flush out the Germans and make the port of Antwerp available for the Allied war effort. [20140916-104022] [20140916-104208] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We were pleasantly surprised to find that the IWM is one of the very few tourist attractions that are free here. This city is horribly expensive. If they could charge you for breathing \"their\" air, I&apos;m sure they would. As it is, they just make you pay through the nose.  But you get that in any major metropolis. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The WWI exhibit was very interesting. One of the things I found most moving was a letter from soldier in France who apologized to his wife for writing such dull letters, because there wasn&apos;t anything going on at the front. I simply don&apos;t understand how people lived with the knowledge that a telegram might arrive bearing terrible news. Not just during the Great War, but for anyone who has or had a loved one on active duty in a war zone.

We also stopped at an optometrist&apos;s to see about getting Eric&apos;s glasses repaired. One of the legs had broken off for no apparent reason, but unfortunately the lady wasn&apos;t able to repair them. So we stopped at a stationery store and bought a tube of Superglue.  It&apos;s holding together so far, so keep your fingers crossed. Fortunately he had a spare pair of glasses with him! [20140916-140107]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After crossing London Bridge we walked along the north bank of the Thames east to the Tower, where over 888 thousand ceramic poppies planted in what used to be castle&apos;s moat represent British and Empire casualties of World War I. I had seriously considered buying one of the poppies, but as they cost 25 pounds and only 10% of that is to benefit veterans&apos; charities I decided not to. [20140916-144705]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Tower itself is actually a far larger complex than either of us had realized. We knew it was part of  the city&apos;s medieval defenses, of course,  but we thought it was just one tower, not an entire castle with moat and chapel and even exotic animals like lions and polar bears, which didn&apos;t get moved to the London zoo until the 19th century. The Queen is so considerate as to send a detachment of her personal guards (the guys in the bear hats) to the Tower every day to help with guard duties, which saved us a trip to Buckingham Palace to snap a picture of them. The Yeoman Guard who conducted the tour was a really funny guy, who started by asking if there were any French people in his audience. No one identified him or herself as French, and he continued to sprinkle his narrative with funny snide remarks about the French.

For example, the restaurant where we ate last night had warnings about possible pickpocket activity in six or seven different languages. Guess which one was last on the list? German, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, all came before French. The English have fought the speakers of all these languages at one time or another. You get that in the process of becoming an empire that covered a quarter of the earth&apos;s surface at its height. This is why the European Union, for all its considerable faults, is such a great idea. It&apos;s a hell of a lot better than everlastingly going to war, at least in my book.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Because it was Eric&apos;s first visit to London he absolutely wanted to ride in a double decker bus, so we took the bus from the Tower back to Trafalgar Square. It also allowed us to sit down after being on our feet almost non stop since 10 a.m. It was rush hour, so the bus took its time crawling westward along The Strand and through Fleet Street. From Trafalgar Square we walked to Leicester Square to see if we could get tickets to the play \"Charles III\" which is about prince Charles planning a coup with the help of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge.  It&apos;s getting great reviews, and going to the theater is a very London sort of thing to do, so why not? We&apos;ll see the show tomorrow, as the only tickets they had left for tonight were close to 90 pounds each!

In fact, the Emirates even have their own tube line, going straight into the City, where a consortium of Emirati businessmen has constructed a glass tower known as \"The Shard,\" and to Harrods, apparently, so their wives can go shopping. [20140916-133647] [20140916-184934] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Harrods was our swan song for the day.

First, we&apos;d lost track of time working on updating our blog, so we had to walk down the Albert Embankment at a pretty brisk trot. It did have the virtue of making jackets unnecessary, but we got to Westminster Bridge all steamy and sweaty. Second, it was pretty overcast, so the view was somewhat disappointing. Doubly so for Eric, because the capsule&apos;s glass wasn&apos;t very clear and that interfered with picture taking, though he did managed to doctor most of them up considerably. Look at the last picture in the set below to see the difference. We were on the first ride of the day, and shared the capsule with a couple from Kentucky, who were kind enough to take a photo of us together, and we of course returned the favor.

There was one closet, which was made to look like the PM&apos;s private toilet, which was actually the secure transatlantic phone line over which he used to talk to President Roosevelt. Churchill couldn&apos;t stand noise of any kind, so his typists had to use special quiet typewriters. The Cabinet or Churchill War Rooms were actually not a bunker, but a converted basement underneath the Treasury building, which had hastily been converted into a somewhat safer bomb shelter by placing a thick slab of concrete over the ground floor. In one spot they&apos;d had to fill a stairwell completely with concrete to make it as safe as possible.  It had been drilled through to make it possible for tourists to complete a circuit. Sound effects like air raid sirens and muffled explosions made it as realistic as possible. I can&apos;t begin to imagine what it must have been like during the Blitz, though. Working in such a rabbit warren without seeing daylight for days on end,  and being conscious all the time that the basement wouldn&apos;t offer real protection in case of a direct or near-direct hit, plus of course the knowledge that people all around were being killed in air raids all the time. We are lucky indeed only to have heard air raid sirens being tested. They used to do that every first Monday of the month at noon when we were kids, but the practice has been discontinued for years now.

He only had one body guard,  in a capital at war, whereas nowadays you can&apos;t even get close enough to 10 Downing Street to see the house number. Huge gates, security checks, armed policemen, the works. [20140917-130133] [20140915-180910]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We were on our way to some of the poshest street and shops in London. First we walked down Picadilly to Fortnum &amp; Mason&apos;s, a huge delicatessen, where we thought we might have lunch. But the lunch menu looked a bit too posh for us, and we didn&apos;t want to wait for tea. That would probably have been pricey, too, but at least one would be able to say one had had that most quintessentially English meal at a London institution. [20140917-131818] [20140917-131926] [20140917-132037] [20140917-132959] [20140917-133137]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Instead we walked back up Picadilly to the Waterstone&apos;s book shop, which has a 5th floor (6th for us Yankees, who count the ground floor as the first) restaurant. After lunch I only had to descent one floor to be in the history department. I happily spent a few hours browsing and reading. [20140917-140618] [20140917-134624] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Waterstone&apos;s we spent an hour or two aimlessly wandering about Picadilly Circus and Leicester Square, until it was time to go to the Wyndham Theater to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/12/king-charles-iii-review-shakespeare-mike-bartlett-wyndhams-tim-pigott-smith\" >King Charles III.</a> Not only was the play very well done and at times very funny, it was also a great cultural experience to watch a West End show at a theatre where Tallulah Bankhead made her stage debut, which has put on plays by Daphne du Maurier, and where Diana Rigg - immortalized as Mrs. Danvers in the film version of Du Maurier&apos;s \"Rebecca\" - appeared on stage. It&apos;s probably not the sort of play that would find any great audience on the other side of the Atlantic, but if it does, I recommend it wholeheartedly!

We made it in time and Nicoline picked up the tickets while I looked at the contraption. I hadn&apos;t realized before that the pods in which the people are actually rotate themselves counter to the rotation of the big wheel (which takes about 30 minutes for one full turn), so that their floors keep horizontal. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-095308] [20140917-095350] [20140917-095950] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-101034] We shared our pod with only one other couple. The windows of the pod were dirty, and added to the fog, the view was a bit disappointing.

Constructed in the basement of the Treasury building, it was protected by a concrete slab that was secretively added between the basement and the first floor. It is unlikely, though, that the slab would have really protected the complex from a direct hit.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-111712] From here, the <em>War Cabinet</em> and the top military would work closely together throughout the war.  They were effective because the War Cabinet only consisted of a handful of ministers, making it possible to make quick decisions.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-113637] [20140917-113959] [20140917-114535] [20140917-115344] [20140917-120117]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-130133] After the War Rooms, we walked through St. James&apos;s Park to Piccadilly Circus, and from there down Piccadilly.

We then went on to Waterstones Book Shop, supposedly the largest book store in Europe. Here we had lunch, and then Nicoline and I went to different floors to browse and read. I ended up going through most of a book on the flash that I have, reminding me of some of the features that might be useful.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-132959] [20140917-133358] [20140917-134624] [20140917-135718] [20140917-140618]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-174343] On we went to Leicester Square, which also seems to be called the \"Swiss Court\". We went into the M&amp;amp;M&apos;s World store, which inspired me to buy a bag of M&amp;amp;Ms for snack&amp;mdash;but at the \"Off License\" store, a corner store a block away, rather than at the M&amp;amp;M store. It was still pretty expensive, but not quite as ridiculous.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-175337] [20140917-174700] [20140917-175210]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-183926] On Trafalgar Square they were setting up for a free screening of the Royal Opera.

Neat trick!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-190717] Then it was time to go to the theater, to see the \"King Charles III\" show we had tickets for. It was a very interesting take on what could happen when Prince Charles would become king. Not that there seems to be much chance of that, the way the current queen is going.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-224446] After the show we took the bus back to the apartment, where it was almost eleven by the time we got back and our host was already asleep.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140917-221415] [20140917-222251] [20140917-222334] [20140917-222544]&lf;&nl;','2014-09-18 11:36:18','C','2014-09-18 11:29:23','N'),('2014-europe','20140918C0001','eric','20140918','London Day 3','[20140918-124623] The third whole day we are in London starts out with domestic chores.

Now, we used to have two levels to store bicycles at our school, and you had to lift your bike to put it on the second level. Not here! The second level slides out and forms a ramp so you can roll your bike on! Very nifty.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140918-133206] At the bus station we take the bus to Brixton, where we find our lunch at an outdoor stall. We continue walking around the market and neighborhood, past a T.J. Maxx (called T.K. Maxx here, to avoid confusion with another brand that start with \"T.J.\"). We see what&apos;s called a \"CCTV spy car\" which is used for parking regulation enforcement, and which seems to have caused a huge uproar about the government driving around spying on everyone. Eventually we end up in a \"99p store\" (like a dollar store, but then in pounds, and tax is of course included in the 99 pence maximum price) before taking the bus again.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140918-131011] [20140918-131434] [20140918-132202] [20140918-132632] [20140918-133157] [20140918-133842] [20140918-134154] [20140918-134752] [20140918-135931] [20140918-140920]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140918-145918] Next stop is Hyde Park, where we get off at the \"Marble Arch\" which is at the corner of Hyde Park where also the Speakers Corner is - an area famous for people bringing a soap box and starting to talk. Nobody was talking when we were there, so we sat down on the lawn (in the shade!) to relax. The idea was to read a bit, but it turned out that my e-book reader was out of battery (maybe buttons got pressed with it sitting in my backpack) so we just sat and looked at the people. And at the weird statue of a horse&apos;s head that  placed just outside of Hyde Park.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140918-150138] [20140918-151000] [20140918-151055] [20140918-151601] [20140918-154237]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140918-171651] From Hyde Park we hop on a bus again to go to the British Library, where we see some of the permanent exhibitions, including the Magna Charta and a Dutch-language edition of The Book of the City of Ladies.

We walk past St. Pancras station (where we will be taking the train tomorrow) and Kings Cross station until we find a place that serves both Indian food and fish-and-chips.

I remembered watching news footage of riots in Brixton, and I thought they were about the poll tax introduced by Margaret Thatcher&apos;s government in the late 1980s. But they weren&apos;t about that. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There were two riots, in 1981 and 1985, and in both cases race was the major factor. In 1981, police in Brixton tried to reduce street crime by stopping and searching people on the mere suspicion of criminal activity. This amounted to young black men being targeted disproportionally, and community protest erupted in a riot. The 1985 riot began when police used excessive force to search for a young black criminal at his mother&apos;s house, severely (and permanently) injuring her. Her son wasn&apos;t even home at the time. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Things may have improved over the last 30 years, but I thought it was interesting that there is a funeral parlor next to the police station, and a lawyer&apos;s office directly opposite that provides legal assistance in cases against the police. We leisurely toured the Brixton market our guidebook recommended, bought Jamaican meat patties for lunch, and spent a fun hour or two in south London.

I took a picture of the little boy because he reminded me of Frank at that age :-) Then we hopped on another bus, which crawled up Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road so very, very slowly that the London Transport Authority or whatever they call themselves nowadays made an announcement that bus travel within zone one (which includes most of central London) would be free due to excessive congestion! Of course it didn&apos;t bother us any, since a slow bus trip gave more time to take in the sights, but it&apos;s the thought that counts.

I&apos;m amazed they didn&apos;t change that after we stopped calling Stalin \"uncle Joe, \" especially when you consider that Brussels was (and is) home to NATO&apos;s European HQ. There used to be a Stalin Avenue in Amsterdam, just as there are still a Roosevelt and a Churchill Avenue, but it was renamed Freedom Avenue in 1956. Even Stalingrad itself is no longer called that.

It is remarkable that we see a lot of police at Kings Cross, with semi-automatics, not just slung around the shoulder but in their hands.

Eventually we find a kiosk for public transportation and we buy 3-day unlimited travel for 17 euros each. That&apos;s the kind of ticket I like!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;With tickets in hand, finding the right tram is easy. Following the instructions we get off at the correct stop, and find the large buildings, but then get confused. It takes ten minutes of wandering around before I manage to see the numbers on the buildings and get into the right entrance. Our host picks us up and shows us the apartment on the second floor (third floor in the U.S.).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140919-174751] After a little bit of rest, we head back into town - without the suitcases it is a lot easier. We take the same tram back to the station, where we don&apos;t find a tourist information (no signs with the \"i\" symbol or anything similar to be found) but we do manage to buy a guide book with a map of the center of Brussels. So we start walking, along the Stalingrad Lane as it happens. Not sure what the Brussels city planners were thinking with having Stalingrad line off of Constitution Square, but there it is.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140919-182155] [20140919-182656] [20140919-182701]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140919-183657] The town has a totally different feel from London (all business) or Dublin (all new). It still has quaint little streets with quaint little shops, and a large central square (\"Grote Markt\") with magnificent old buildings.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140919-184321] [20140919-184717] [20140919-184728] [20140919-190740]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140919-190927] We have dinner at the square. Well, that is, we decide to go with an appetizer (\"kaas kroketten\") and desert (crepes for me, a cheese platter for Nicoline) instead of a full meal. But they taste well and by the time we&apos;re done it&apos;s getting dark. We manage to find a bus and tram back to the apartment. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140919-194303] [20140919-194308] [20140919-195908] [20140919-195945]&lf;&nl;','2014-09-20 08:25:41','C','2014-09-20 08:22:10','N'),('2014-europe','20140920C0001','eric','20140920','Exploring Brussels','[20140920-111733] Today we start out by tracing back our steps from last night, to the main market square (\"Grote Markt\") and the tourist information there. We take tram and bus to get there, and with it now being light, get to see a bit more of the town.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-110751] [20140920-111745] [20140920-112607]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-115127] Getting out of the bus, we see a sign for Manneke Pis, so we take a detour seeking out this famous monument of a naked little boy peeing. You can say what you want, but at least the Belgians aren&apos;t as prudish as Americans! The monument was dressed up today and there were throngs of tourists around, so we couldnâ€™t really get a close look, but conveniently the waffle stand next door had a more-than-life-size replica. And a delicious waffle :-).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-115201] [20140920-115319]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-121417] Continuing on to the market square, there is a group singing on the platform and we listen for a moment before checking out the tourist information, where we learned where we could buy road maps for the next part of our vacation, by car. After taking a picture of the restaurant &apos;t Kelderke where we ate yesterday, we head out.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-121120] [20140920-121401] [20140920-121813] [20140920-121749]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-121857] We don&apos;t make it off the square yet, though, as we stumble on the \"Maison du Roi\", the museum of the city of Brussels. It has a specific exhibition on Brussels in the first world war, and this weekend is \"monument weekend\" at which there is no entrance fee to many museums, so how could we resist... An exhibition on Brussels craft with wood cuts, paintings, chinaware and more precedes the WW-I exhibition.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-122243] [20140920-122741] [20140920-124145] [20140920-123651] [20140920-122957]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-130035] The exhibition on Brussels in the first World War shows many artifacts of how the people in Brussels coped with the occupation, including (illegal) cartoons, games, proclamations and more. One paper warns, in German, that Belgium would be the British \"deployment zone\" and includes a picture of a channel tunnel. This shows one of the reasons why the channel tunnel, which was proposed over two hundred years ago, did not actually get built until the 1990s (construction stated in 1988).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-125749] [20140920-125619] [20140920-125813] [20140920-130131]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-130642] Next door to the WW-I exhibition was Manneke Pis&apos; Wardrobe, a display of all the different costumes. It seems that the statue has more than 800 costumes, so clearly not all are on display.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-130535] [20140920-130556] [20140920-130736] [20140920-130810] [20140920-130847] [20140920-130858] [20140920-130932] [20140920-131004]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-132007] Finally we <em>do</em> get to leave the market square, and by now it&apos;s lunch time. We get a bag of fries (\"friet\") with mayonnaise (yes, this is considered a meal in Holland and Belgium) which we eat in front of the Koninklijke Muntschouwburg. We then succeed in buying the road map we were looking for and find a bus to take us to the Atomium. The bus driver must have been a rookie; he cut three corners, stopped to talk with another bus driver, and had to back up on a busy square, supposedly because he forgot he had to turn left there.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-132048] [20140920-134930] [20140920-144606]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-150709] <a href=&apos;images/p0820.jpg&apos; class=&apos;_blank&apos;><img class=&apos;right&apos; src=&apos;images/p0820.jpg&apos; alt=&apos;atomium in 1958&apos;/></a> My father has been to the 1958 World Fair, for which the Atomium was built. He used to have a little souvenir model of the Atomium on his desk. Having seen that model for 50+ years, I&apos;ve always wanted to visit the display of an iron crystal. On the right is one of my father&apos;s photos from 1958.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140920-152139] We first visit the exhibition of the 1958 World Fair, using escalators and stairs.

Since the tourist information office on the Grand Place (French pronunciation, please) was already closed when we got there last night, we decided to go there first, so we would have some idea of what&apos;s happening here this weekend.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;For example, Sunday is a day without cars. A few times a year, Brussels declares a car-free Sunday, on which public transport is free and people can walk or bike or rollerblade where they please (though still keeping an eye out for trams and buses, of course). I remember having car-free Sundays when I was a kid, not because of local government largesse, but because of a shortage of oil caused by events in the Middle East, and what a thrill it was to rollerskate on blacktop roads that were normally reserved for car traffic. [20140920-110751]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Since the famous statue of Manneke Pis was only a block away from the tourist information office, we decided to stop there first. It was very crowded because there was some kind of celebration going on at the base of the statue. A men&apos;s choir sang a cappella, and later lead a procession pushing a cart with a Manneke Pis replica that squirted water. I have absolutely no idea what it was about, but it looked and sounded very festive. [20140920-115201] [20140920-115127] [20140920-121401]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Unfortunately, the information bureau didn&apos;t have a road map of Belgium and Holland, which we&apos;ll need Monday once we pick up the rental car. The lady referred us to a shopping mall some distance away, and we decided to walk there, but not before we&apos;d done another tour around the square. There we happened upon an explanation for a sight that had puzzled us last night: The strange flags flying from the \"maison de roi\" (the king&apos;s house), now the city museum. [20140920-121857] [20140920-122011]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The flags are black, white, and red and are the colors of Imperial Germany, which occupied Brussels during World War I. Of course we have to go inside and see the accompanying exhibition, and also the other works of art that are on display. I knew Brussels was famous for its painting, sculpture, and tapestry, but I didn&apos;t know it had also been famous for its porcelain painting and silver work. [20140920-122243] [20140920-122305] [20140920-122741]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The exhibition on Brussels during the First World War was interesting. I was shocked to learn that food shortages were already noticeable by the end of August 1914, barely a month after the outbreak of war! The Allied blockade of Germany worked as planned, and I doubt that the German plan of using Holland - which remained neutral because Germany chose not to attack it in August 1914 - as a lifeline was much help. Indeed, my late paternal grandmother once told me that the bread they had during the First World War was worse even than the bread soup kitchens provided during the last winter (known colloquially as the Hunger Winter) of World War II. [20140920-125508] [20140920-125813] [20140920-130131] [20140920-130304] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On the same floor as the World War I exhibition we also found a Manneke Pis exhibition. The little fellow has quite an impressive wardrobe! [20140920-130642] [20140920-130736] [20140920-130810] [20140920-130847] [20140920-130858] [20140920-130932] [20140920-131004] [20140920-130535]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the king&apos;s house we walked toward the map-selling shopping mall, stopping along the way for french fries. The proper kind, with mayonnaise,  in a paper cone. We stopped to enjoy them in a square which happened to be the Mint Square, home to the Royal Theater of the Mint  (\"La Monnaie\" in French, \"De Munt\" in Dutch for short) the cradle of Belgian independence from Holland in 1830. But since I know next to nothing about that period, except that the Dutch went to war against the Belgians for all of 10 days, after which the major powers pressured the Dutch to give in, we decided not to check it out any further. [20140920-132007] [20140920-134930] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Besides, we spotted a promising-looking bookstore at the far side of the square. They did indeed sell road maps,  so that saved us quite a hike. The weather was still holding, despite a forecast calling for mid-day thunderstorms,  so we hopped on a bus (Eric had bought two passes for unlimited use of public transport for 72 hours) to the Atomium, home of the 1958 World Expo. His father had visited it the year it opened, but neither Eric nor I had ever been there. [20140920-150709]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To be honest, it was rather disappointing. It looked fascinating from the outside, very futuristic still, despite its 56 years, but only the first two or three \"floors\" were interesting. It told the story of the Atomium&apos;s design and construction and had a lot of 1950s memorabilia. But the upper floors are exhibition spaces for contemporary artists who work in wool, ceramics, and wood, in an echo of the city&apos;s artistic heyday of the 13th to 17th century. I suppose I&apos;m rather a philistine,  but I rarely like modern art. Also, I am sad to report, there was a group of Dutch kids at the Atomium who had not yet been instructed as to the proper modulation of their voices for indoor use. There were only about half a dozen of the little hooligans,  but they sounded like a monkey house. On steroids.

As it turns out, the statue is in another park, Le Sablon. Perhaps we&apos;ll get around to visiting that tomorrow. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Egmont Park we took the tram back to the flat,  and after stopping at a local supermarket to buy dinner, spent a quiet evening reading.&lf;&nl;','2014-09-21 09:14:32','C','2014-09-21 08:50:27','N'),('2014-europe','20140921C0001','nicoline','20140921','Last day in Brussels','Yet again we&apos;ve been incredibly lucky. It was drizzly when we got up, and by the time we left it had begun to rain. But by the time we reached Kleine Zavel/Le  Sablon park it was dry, though overcast,  and later in the afternoon the sun even came out. But let&apos;s start at the beginning. We had a leisurely breakfast with coffee,  orange juice, and fresh croissants from the corner bakery, while we worked on updating our blog and figuring out what to do today. [20140921-090329]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As it turned out, the statue we couldn&apos;t find yesterday was actually close to where we were, just in a different park. In addition to the statue depicting  counts Egmont and Hoorne, there were statues of Guillaume le Taciturne (William the Silent, the pater patrias of The Netherlands) and Philippe Marnix de Ste. Aldegonde, who is traditionally credited with composing the acrostic that later became the Dutch national anthem. The other statues there most likely depicted other nobles at the court of Margaret of Parma, half-sister of king Philip II of Spain, whose territory included the Low Countries,  but I must admit I didn&apos;t recognize any of their names. [20140921-120804] [20140921-121314] [20140921-121231]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I wanted to visit the Army Museum (MusÃ©e Royal d&apos;ArmÃ©e et d&apos;Histoire Militaire/Koninklijk Museum van het Leger en de Krijgsgeschiedenis) because of its special World War I exhibit. To get there we had to go through their regular exhibit of earlier uniforms and weaponry. I suppose we should count ourselves lucky it didn&apos;t go back as far as the Roman conquest. There has certainly been plenty of bloodshed in this small corner of Europe. Again, hurray for European unity! Warts and all, it sure beats the heck out of what came before. [20140921-131708] [20140921-131516] [20140921-133753] [20140921-132242]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The World War I exhibit was very well done, with plenty of attention to the causes of the war and last minute efforts at diplomacy, but also individual soldiers&apos; accounts in French, Flemish, German, and English. I must admit that I relied on subtitles for French. Poor Belgium suffered terribly, starting with their gallant but futile refusal to allow the German army to pass over Belgian territory unhindered.  The German ambassador, upon learning that the Belgians would not accede to their demand for safe passage, said \"The poor fools!\" It did slow the German army considerably to have to fight its way past the fortresses at LiÃ¨ge, Namur, and Dinant, and it was certainly a factor in why the Schlieffen Plan didn&apos;t work out. The Kaiser allegedly summarized this plan as \"lunch in Paris; dinner in St. Petersburg.\" [20140921-134148]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I was surprised to see how Germans have always had a talent for making people hate them. Not just because of the violation of a neutral country, or the atrocities committed against the civilian population of more than one Belgian city, but the most minute regulations of every aspect of everyday life by proclamation upon proclamation, until the walls of city halls were simply covered in them. It&apos;s something I&apos;d always associated with World War II, but that&apos;s possibly because the First World War never received much attention in grade school history lessons. [20140921-143800] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By the time we&apos;d finished our tour of the exhibit and stepped outside, the sun had come out and the car free Sunday celebrations were in full swing. There was something going on in nearly every square and park we saw today! Say what you will about Belgians, but they sure know how to celebrate. We took the metro back into town to find a chocolaterie where we could buy real Belgian bonbons for my mom, but the streets around the Grand Place were so crowded in places you could barely move. But we did manage to find the bonbons, as well as souvenirs of Brussels: a metal cat to keep Aapje Interstate company, and a silk scarf that will go with nearly every item of clothing I possess, including my County Donegal socks. To cap it all, we had a great dinner in town, with mussels \"diablo\" for me and duck with orange sauce for Eric!

People get around by public transportation (which is free on those days), bicycles or by foot. Everyone&apos;s walking on the street, only having to watch out for the trams, buses, taxis and police cars. Today was one of such days. I have to say I think it is a great idea!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-090329] Anyway, we start the day with breakfast fresh from the corner store. We wait out much of the morning, as we were having the first rain of our vacation this morning, and the expectation was for the weather to clear up later in the day. The rain was only a drizzle, though, so we headed out by eleven-thirty and around noon the rain has stopped completely. It wasn&apos;t as warm as it has been, though, only mid to upper sixties.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-120145] We got off the metro at the Palais de Justice where we immediately ran into a monument to the 1914-18 war. The square was turned into some kind of a beach area, probably part of today&apos;s celebrations. It turns out that this looks out over much of the city, so we stopped to enjoy the view.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-115840] [20140921-115853] [20140921-115949] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-120804] We did find the statue of the Counts of Egmont and Hoorne, who played such an important role in the Dutch uprising. Looking around the park Kleine Zwavel where we found the statue, I noticed interesting bronze statues around the edge of the park. According to <a href=&apos;http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zavel_%28Brussel%29#Kleine_Zavel&apos; target=&apos;_blank&apos;>Wikipedia (Dutch)</a>, these are 48 statues representing the Brussels guilds, of which I took some pictures as examples.

From there we took the subway again towards the army museum.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-123539] [20140921-123808] [20140921-124826] [20140921-124957] [20140921-125217]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-131012] In the army museum, we particularly wanted to the the 1914-18 exhibition, and it turned out to be a very well-done exhibition, more focused on the personal stories of the war than the strategic army movements and such. Well worth the entrance fee. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-134148] [20140921-140048] [20140921-143126] [20140921-143800] [20140921-144623]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-150334] The army museum is located in the Jubilee Park, so named because it was created to celebrate the 50 years of independence from Holland in 1880.

The arches were added in 1905, at the 75-year independence celebration.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140921-153226] From the army museum we went back to the center of town and walked around there a bit.

I think Nicoline liked it (I&apos;m not a beer drinker).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140922-082249] We have been happy with our \"AirBnb\" locations so far (Dublin, London and now in Brussels). It is definitely different from a hotel, not only in that you don&apos;t have your room cleaned every day and have to share the bathroom with the owners of the apartment (which I don&apos;t feel is a problem), but also because you can leave your stuff in the room and don&apos;t have to worry about a lot of people having access to it. I feel that the hosts are trusting us with their whole house and all their stuff, so I don&apos;t feel worried leaving my electronics, passports and stuff behind in the room. I wouldn&apos;t do that in a hotel.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140922-083254] Another advantage is that you are in a regular residential neighborhood, not in a tourist area. You get a better feel of how people actually live in the country, use their public transportation, and are not always running around as a part of a pack of tourists. Like here in Brussels, we used the \"pattiserie\" (bakery) on the corner for our breakfast, which is what people here do (or at least, used to do).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140922-092210] We started the day early, I got up at seven thirty (Nicoline was already up, of course), had coffee and finished our packing and stuff, then took the tram back to the train station where we picked up our rental car. We found a deal where we could pick the car up in Brussels and drop it off at Amsterdam airport when we leave next Tuesday, which is very convenient.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140922-104320] After getting our suitcases from the apartment, we drive in the direction of St. Symphorien, which has a military cemetery that includes both German and English soldiers.

We headed southwest, to Mons (Bergen), where I wanted to visit the St. Symphorien military cemetery. I&apos;d been on the fence about going there, to be honest, because there&apos;s really nothing to see but graves. But in the end I was glad we went. The cemetery is on land donated for the purpose by a local, on the condition that it be used to honor the dead on both sides of the conflict. And so there are nearly as many German as British war graves. Some are unidentified, and those I found most moving. As a parent, I couldn&apos;t help feeling for Rudyard Kipling, who wrote the text on the headstones: \"A soldier of the Great War. Known unto God.\" Kipling&apos;s own son was killed in 1915 and his body was not identified until 1992, more than 50 years after his father&apos;s death.

Their resistence, at great cost to soldiers and civilians alike, may have cost Germany the chance to complete the Schlieffen plan, but it was also a factor in creating the static trench war that followed. Some of British graves at St. Symphorien are believed to be both of the first and last casualties of the war, which underscores what a criminal waste that war was.

It also used to be the hometown of a major Dutch brewery, Grolsch, though the brewery has moved to a huge new plant on the outskirts of Enschede since. We found a store where we bought a pound of licorice, which we ate for lunch :-) [20140923-105837] [20140923-105801] [20140923-111537] [20140923-112300] [20140923-112720] [20140923-113206] [20140923-113808] [20140923-113848] [20140923-122953] [20140923-111241]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At 2 p.m. we met with Ineke at her office because she was going to a nearby nature preserve for a walk.

We spent about an hour and a half there, and then we drove to Ineke&apos;s house, where we met her husband Jan and her son Eric. We just had time for a cup of coffee, before we had to head out to the university to pick up Frank, with Ineke acting as our guide.

The timing for our trip to Holland was organized around us being with them today, and around the coming weekend with the whole family (Nicoline and her siblings, and all our children) going to an as-of-yet-undisclosed location.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140925-094728] Our day started out with a bit of a blunder, in that we hadn&apos;t realized that our landlady in the AirBnb where we are would be providing breakfast. So we had stayed in our rooms, finishing up yesterday&apos;s diary and stuff, and when we were ready to leave, we found a nice breakfast waiting for us in the hallway. So Nicoline had to apologize since by now we were late and had to run.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140925-104630] We went to the shopping center (practically next door) where we bought flowers, a cake and four pastries, then went to my in-laws. The flowers were for a vase that we had engraved with the date and occasion.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140925-092509] We started out with a pastries breakfast, before others would come. We actually had not much of an idea of what to expect in the form of visit, given that my in-laws have lived in the same village for over 40 years and know a lot of people.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140925-121502] A number of people did come in over the day, including aunts and uncles of Nicoline; others would just bring flowers or a card and not come in.

[20140926-075811] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After lunch we loaded up the car with suitcases, backpacks, and other assorted carriers to the point that I think we couldn&apos;t have fitted in a box of matches.

We used to rent a cottage in Bloemendaal, just north of Zandvoort, when I was a kid, so the route was very familiar to them. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;And so we arrived at Zandvoort, settled ourselves into the various cottages, took the first of what will no doubt be many walks on the beach, and continued the party. [20140926-155918] [20140926-155933] [20140926-155940] [20140926-164154] &lf;&nl;','2014-09-27 07:50:18','C','2014-09-27 07:45:20','N'),('2014-europe','20140927C0001','nicoline','20140927','Zandvoort','I took a trip down memory lane today. After everybody cleared out right about lunch time and my parents said they were too tired to go anywhere and would prefer to sit and read  quietly for a while, Eric and I went for a walk on the beach.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We headed north, towards Bloemendaal, where we used to have a cottage on the beach almost every summer when we were kids. Zandvoort was the larger town where we&apos;d go grocery shopping. We&apos;d be out playing on beach all day, building forts against the tide, never once losing hope that tomorrow&apos;s fort was going to be the biggest and sturdiest ever and would definitely not get washed away by the tide. With our back to the dunes that form the first line of Dutch sea defenses. [20140927-133842] [20140927-135722] [20140927-135731] [20140927-135855] [20140927-141548]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I don&apos;t remember there being quite  as much trash, though. Or we&apos;d go looking for shells, and sometimes found real pretty ones, though probably not among the ones the seagulls got to first. I don&apos;t remember seeing those little crab-like creatures, though. Hopefully it&apos;s a sign the water is getting cleaner. [20140927-135924] [20140927-135338] [20140927-140029]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Just to the north of Bloemendaal is IJmuiden, home to the largest steel plant in Holland, and a major shipping port at the mouth of the North Sea Canal that connects Amsterdam to the sea. When the prevailing winds failed to prevail, clumps of tar or smudges of oil would sometimes drift down the coast. We&apos;d step in them while playing or swimming and nothing but a vigorous rubbing with an old rag soaked in mineral spirits would take it off. People who camped on the beach kept jugs of that stuff on hand. [20140927-141231] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;If we felt very adventurous we&apos;d sometimes go into the dunes and play in and around disused World War II bunkers. In the 1970s they hadn&apos;t yet deteriorated to the point of being unsafe to enter, but we weren&apos;t allowed to go there anyway because those bunkers were in lonely spots where nobody could see or hear us if anything happened.  Or if we were very disobedient, we walk north until we came to the nudist beach and goggle at people not wearing bathing suits. The nude beach is still there, but we didn&apos;t feel like walking there. It was much too cold for sunbathing, nude or otherwise, anyway. There were plenty of people in the water, despite its being barely above freezing. We used to swim here as kids and the cold never bothered us, but nowadays I really only consider the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean suitable for bathing. [20140927-141548] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We didn&apos;t feel that adventurous, so we climbed back to the top of the dunes and allowed ourselves a treat: ice cream for Eric and Nutricia chocolate milk for me. It&apos;s the only ready-made kind I like, and I only ever get to drink it in Holland. When we were kids we rarely got an ice cream. Maybe twice in a four-week vacation, but we no doubt nagged my mom and dad about it much more often than that. Sometimes they&apos;d let us get what we called a \"sour bomb,\" a large pickle at one of the fish stands that plied their trade right on the beach. Those were only 25 cents each, but we could never manage to eat the whole thing. [20140927-141916] [20140927-142555] [20140927-142527]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One thing that hasn&apos;t changed at all is the Dutch coast&apos;s popularity with German tourists. I remember walking in seaside towns and seeing sign after sign in people&apos;s windows advertising \"Zimmer frei.\" It was an early analog version of Airbnb, just folks with a spare room who didn&apos;t mind sharing their personal space with strangers for a couple of days or weeks. We didn&apos;t see any of those on our walk today, but we did see a camp site completely booked up, even though the tourist season is really over by now. It was so busy because there&apos;s some kind of race going on at the Zandvoort circuit, which is right next to the bungalow park. How they ever managed to get a permit for a racing circuit in the middle of the Dutch sea defenses (zeewering; literally to bar the sea) and a water filtration area from which most of western Holland gets its drinking water I don&apos;t know,  but it was there when I was a kid and we would sometimes hear ambulances and fire trucks rushing over there when accidents happened. [20140927-143519] [20140927-143843] [20140927-145403] [20140927-145129]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;For dinner we all 17 of us went to a stir fry restaurant in Hoofddorp. It sat right next to one of the newest runways at Schiphol, but the place was so noisy we never heard any planes. My mother asked if celebrating a golden wedding anniversary qualified us for any discounts, but they didn&apos;t buy that. Instead they made them stand for a fire cracker display and gave them a boxed set of Chinese bowls and chopsticks.

The weather was nice enough today, lower seventies, although there were some clouds.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-140240] Nicoline and I went for a walk along the beach in the afternoon. Most of the Dutch Northsea coast has beautiful sand beaches, which are augmented (sand added) regularly to keep them nice and wide for the tourists. The beaches are pretty clean, although there are some spots where shells and little crabs seem to wash on the shore - and the seagulls come to feed. In some spots people had made a \"castle\" or a still-life display.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-134433] [20140927-140029] [20140927-135731] [20140927-135338] [20140927-140134]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-141548] The sand beach lies in front of the dunes, which protect the land behind them from the sea. We climbed the stairs to the top of the dunes, where we sat down at a snack bar, me having a soft ice and Nicoline a \"chocomel.\" The sparrows weren&apos;t shy, searching for crumbs that were left over. Some of them even went all the way into the vending cart.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-141916] [20140927-142555] [20140927-142535] [20140927-142613]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-144411] We walked back along the road over the dunes back to the resort, and came past the Zandvoort racing circuit where some kind of race was going on.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-144538] [20140927-145129]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20140927-181136] For dinner we went with everyone to the \"Holly Wok\" in Hoofddorp, which is like an all-you-can-eat buffet so everyone can figure out their own meal.

After spending more time at the Space &amp; Rocket Center than we&apos;d foreseen, and running into what must have been the only traffic jam in northern Alabama,  we didn&apos;t make it all the way to Memphis. The smart thing to do would have been to find a place to stay in Corinth, Miss., but of course we had to push on just that bit farther. So now we&apos;re at the Magnolia Inn in Holly Springs. I don&apos;t know what kind of magnolias they grown here, but it&apos;s definitely nothing to do with the whiteness of the laundry. The sheets have a decidedly gray cast, half the light fixtures are missing bulbs, and the cover of the ironing board was last changed during Reagan&apos;s second term. Not that that matters, since someone stole the iron... And what really takes the biscuit is that a big storm went through last night and knocked most of the town&apos;s internet.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The weather has been rather iffy down here, no doubt because of that hurricane raking up Florida&apos;s spine over the weekend.  It was sticky all day today, but since we spent most of it inside at the Space &amp; Rocket Center that didn&apos;t  bother us much. I&apos;d found out Sunday evening that the Burritt House is closed on Mondays, but we planned to drive up there anyway, just to see what kind of house the U.S. government made available to a recently decommissioned SS  SturmbannfÃ¼hrer.  You&apos;d hardly know this Wernher von Braun had lived in Nazi Germany, much less been a party member and a scientist working on two of Hitler&apos;s pet projects, the V-1 and V-2 rockets. They actually had a V-2 at the Saturn V exhibit building, but I found out during the tour of the military facility that&apos;s part of the Marshall Space Center that it was only a replica built by U.S. scientists after the war. The *real* thing would&apos;ve been found terrorizing London and Londoners, but from the display you&apos;d scarcely realize it was even a weapon of any kind![20150831-091942] [20150831-101553]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Space exploration has never been my thing.

Heretical, but there it is. At first I thought the Space &amp; Rocket Center wouldn&apos;t be an appropriate venue to bring Marching Monkey to,  but he made the acquintance of a very nice space monkey called Ms. Baker. Actually, he made the acquitance with her mortal remains, since she died after a long life at NASA back in the 1980s.

A rather important military engagement took place there, but since it coincided with the Battle of Gettysburg on July 4, 1863 it has not received the recognition it deserves according to one of the people at the Delta Heritage Center, who was not only extremely knowledgeable about the history of the blues in the region, but is also a Civil War buff and takes part in re-enactments. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Delta  Cultural Center was high on my list of things to do in Arkansas, and it was quite an experience.

It has been hosted by \"Sunshine\" Sunny Payne since 1951, and today was the 17,331st broadcast. Mr. Payne is a blues musician of considerable reputation himself, having played with the all the greats, including B.B. King and Elvis. He didn&apos;t like the latter, because he caught Elvis signing his name on the thigh of a young lady back in &apos;51 or &apos;52, which he considered highly offensive, and he asked him to leave the club where they were playing after that.

It helped that Union troops had help from a gun boat down on the Mississippi that shelled the Confederates as they charged uphill.

The marker, put there by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1926, marks the spot used as the baseline in later surveys, when the newly acquired land was going to be parceled out to veterans of the War of 1812. The area is a swamp, and the boardwalk provided is there to protect the land as well as the visitors, since alligators are native to the area. I&apos;d never realized Arkansas, or at least the eastern  part of it is basically a swamp! [20150901-134849] [20150901-135009] [20150901-135108] [20150901-140535] [20150901-141121] [20150901-141257]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the Louisiana Purchase marker we drove west on US 49 and 79 to Pine Bluff, where we wanted to visit the Delta Rivers Nature Center. OK, the Governor Mike Huckabee Delta Rivers Nature Center. We truly went there with an open mind, expecting to find a beautiful park, but the closer we came, the less hope we had. It&apos;s surrounded by a cotton processing with its own railroad,  a discount lumber &amp;  building materials place, a sports park with baseball fields, a golf course, and a marina. All endeavors not especially noted for their environment-friendly practices. The nature center building is home to some live animals, mostly reptiles, but also a lone bald eagle, while little effort has been made to provide the animals with anything even approximating a habitat, just pictures thereof in otherwise featureless cages. The \"nature trail\" on which visitors can walk around the property consists of a badly maintained boardwalk - seriously, they can&apos;t send someone down the trail with a screw driver and a hammer to screw or nail boards back into place? - from which we did see some turtles and birds, but nothing much else, except a lot of trash that didn&apos;t look as if it had just been dumped there yesterday, either, including an entire oil drum all rusted through. I think the area was just a piece of land of no use to anyone else, so Huckabee and his handlers probably thought it might do him good, PR-wise, to make it a nature center. Or if I&apos;m really being cynical, the whole site is a brownfield, and turning it into a  nature center is a cheaper way of dealing with it than doing an actual cleanup...&lf;&nl;[20150901-161845] [20150901-162759] [20150901-164023] [20150901-164130]','2015-09-02 03:37:15','D','2015-09-02 02:06:11','N'),('2015-oklahoma','20150901D0002','eric','20150901','Helena, Arkansas and more','The motel we found last night was cheap, but as per usual, you end up getting what you pay for. [20150901-064656] I mentioned already it didn&apos;t have internet, which we can live with. But the lamps next to the bed didn&apos;t have light bulbs, and when we switched with bulbs in other lamps in the room, we found that the bedside lamps actually had their plugs cut off from the cord. Also, the smoke alarm had been removed. And as icing on the cake there was a cricket hiding in the room somewhere, which kept Nicoline awake most of the night.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-070420] We left really early and continued our travel through Northern Mississippi, looking for a place to have breakfast.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-070710] Like yesterday afternoon, one of the remarkable features of the landscape was the stretches where everything was totally overgrown with Kudzu. Kudzu, which has been called \"the vine that ate the South\", is almost impossible to contain once it starts overgrowing an area. It has its own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu_in_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia article</a>.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-075459] We have breakfast at a Waffle House (always a good fallback!) where they had a new menu option: the Apple Crumble Waffle. Definitely interesting, although I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ll have it again. I think I prefer my waffle plain (I don&apos;t even like butter on it), with plenty of syrup.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-091319] We continue towards Arkansas, and shortly before reaching the Mississippi river we wonder what the plants with the white dots are in the field we&apos;re passing. Would that be cotton? Yes, it is. Much lower than the cotton plants we&apos;ve seen before, but clearly still cotton. We see all stages of the plant, from flower to seed pod to open cotton.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-091258] [20150901-091540] [20150901-091349] [20150901-091523] [20150901-091617]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-093300] We cross the Mississippi river and enter into Arkansas, a state we&apos;ve set foot in before but never really visited. So we start out at the welcome center not far beyond the bridge where a helpful lady gives us a lot of information about the town Helena and things we may want to see there.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The first thing on our list is the boardwalk to the river, but driving through town we [20150901-101326] come across this T-33 Shooting Star fighter jet in the middle of town. Guess who had to stop to take a picture?&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-103701] We do get to the river, and get to go down all the way to the water&apos;s edge. As we all know, the Mississippi will grow and shrink, depending on the amount of water its tributaries contribute. Right now it&apos;s low (although not extremely low like a couple of years ago, when ships couldn&apos;t use most of the river) so the land on its edge is dry land, cracked from the baking sun. It forms beautiful patterns...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-102336] [20150901-102745]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Back in town, we visit the Delta Cultural Center. Here we learn about \"King Biscuit Time\", a radio show five days a week which started on November 21, 1941 and has been going on ever since. It started out sponsored by a local flour brand but has become a phenomenon in its own right since. [20150901-105248]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It turns out that the host of the show, \"Sunshine\" Sonny Payne, has been the host since 1951. A World War II veteran, Mr. Payne will be 90 years on in November, and he still continues to present this 30-minute show five days a week. [20150901-124052]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Nicoline and I ended up as guests on the show. Today&apos;s episode can be downloaded <a href=\"http://kffa.dataride-previews.com/radioaudio/kffa/kbt090115.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, although I don&apos;t know how long that episode will remain available. We are there about 16 minutes 45 seconds into the show.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Delta cultural center [20150901-111046] also had a special exhibition of face masks of many famous blues artists, which officially opened today. Its regular exhibitions tell the story of the blues in the \"delta\" (which is really a large area around the Mississippi river, not really literally the river delta).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Before leaving Helena, we visit the site of a civil war battle in the area, [20150901-125921] the Battle of Helena, which is marked by sculptures of soldiers, kind-of like sketches. There was supposed to be a nice view over the town, but most of that view was obstructed by trees.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Next stop is the <em>Louisiana Purchase State Park</em>. The Louisiana Purchase is the  transaction where president Jefferson bought a huge tract of land from the French, more than doubling the territory of the United States in 1803. Once bought, the territory had to be surveyed, and to do this, baselines had to be established. The north-south and the east-west baselines met in a place in Arkansas, around which the Louisiana Purchase State Park is established. [20150901-141257] The area is really a swamp, as is common around here (\"headwater swamps\", which are swamps that don&apos;t fluctuate as much as other types of swamp). Supposedly there are alligators in the area, although we only see turtles and some kind of lizard.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150901-141121] [20150901-140706] [20150901-141223] [20150901-142714]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the state park we continue to Pine Bluff, where we end up finding a hotel (a Best Western this time, after our experience with a cheap place last night). Before getting to the hotel, we visit the Delta Rivers Nature Center, which was a little bit of a disappointment. They did have animals in small displays in the nature center, but the trail around the grounds was not really exciting. And there seemed to be an awful lot of trash left in the swampy areas. [20150901-164130]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The day was concluded with a dinner at Chili&apos;s, after which it was time to catch up with the diary entries.[20150901-174644]','2015-09-02 03:12:50','D','2015-09-02 02:24:20','N'),('2015-oklahoma','20150902D0001','eric','20150902','Surprises, surprises','One of the things I love about the vacations Nicoline and I take, is that unexpected things happen. We do some preparation: I read websites, Nicoline gets books from the library, and we jot down ideas. We look at the points of interest we idendified and see where they&apos;re all located. This gives us a rough idea of our route. But when we&apos;re actually on the road, a lot of that is thrown out the door, and we go where inspiration takes us.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-192503] Yesterday, we ended up in a radio show. Today, we end up camping in Queen Wilhelmina State Park. Although I was the one insisting we bring our camping gear, I wasn&apos;t expecting to use it until we were in western Oklahoma. I guess Nicoline was planning to go camping much earlier than that. So here we are, sitting in front of our tents, Nicoline reading a book and me working on the photos and diary. We will see how the night in the tent goes...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-103530] After breakfast this morning we started out towards Little Rock. The first stop was the <em>Little Rock Central High School</em>, the site of the 1957 \"Little Rock Nine\" action against seggregation in the South. To our surprise, the high school is still a working high school in Little Rock, so you can&apos;t actually go in, but the National Park Service has a visitor center across the street that provides a lot of the historical information (a very useful refresher for me, for I have to admit that unlike Nicoline I don&apos;t have all the details of American history exactly in my head).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The visitor center showed a movie that was made in 1964 about the Little Rock Nine by the federal government, to be shown in foreign countries. Basically a propaganda movie. Interesting, but as the park ranger warned us, it was clearly lacking some context.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As so often recently the thing that struck me once more this morning is how little really has been achieved since 1957. The lines aren&apos;t drawn as absolute as they were in the Jim Crow era, but we haven&apos;t come nearly as far as we would like to think.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By the way, if you think this is something specific to the \"south\", think again. This is [20150902-100010] a photo of protest against integration in Poolesville, Maryland. Slogans like \"Integration is communism\", \"integration is unchristian\", \"keep Poolesville white\" and \"put me down as &apos;no&apos; nigger lover\".&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-110512] Anyway, from the high school we went downtown, looked along the river front and crossed the Arkansas river on a pedestrian bridge. In the end, it was way too hot to spend much time in a city, so we had a quick lunch in an indoor market and went back to the car for our next treck.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-110216] [20150902-111818] [20150902-114836] [20150902-120143] [20150902-120158]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-134427] We follow the interstate (I-40) to a town caled Dardanelle, where we do some grocery shopping. Nicoline thought it would be funny to drive through this town, which we did. From here we followed various scenic routes towards Mena.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-141639] We repeatedly saw signs for a nuclear evacuation route, and wondered if that was a left-over from the cold war. But the signs were new. Some googling showed that \"Nuclear One\" is actually the first (and only) nuclear power plant in Arkansas, located on Lake Dardanelle. Mystery solved!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-144414] The drive through Western Arkansas is beautiful, but then the question of where to sleep comes up. Nicoline suggests calling the Queen Wilhelmina State Park. That park has been intriguing us for a long time, because it&apos;s named after a former Dutch queen. So I call and we find that although rooms at the lodge are expensive, they do have some tent sites available. We reserve one, and drive on through Mena onto the <em>Talimena Scenic Drive</em>&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-172327] The scenic drive is indeed pretty scenic, with a number of overlooks where you can see far over the Ouachita Mountains. We enter the park and arrive at the lodge where we get the pass for the campsite we reserved. In less than half an hour, the tent was set and we were sitting in front of it, reading.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-173104] [20150902-173656] [20150902-174114] [20150902-174628] [20150902-181205]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-211759] It turns out that a lot of the other campers (mainly with RVs and such, one person had a minivan with probably a mattress in the back) were ham radio enthusiasts. The camping site on top of a mountain ridge, away from major cities must work well for them. I guess many of them had come early in anticipation of the yearly Hamfest (first weekend after labor day). But another thing that works well camping high up away from cities is star gazing. Which we did. We deliberately waited until it was really dark and took a look up to the sky. And of course I spent some time taking photos as well, which actually turned out really well this time. By they way, you may want to click on the photos here to see the full size ones.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150902-210708] [20150902-211118] [20150902-211856] [20150902-212222] [20150902-212311]&lf;&nl;','2015-09-03 22:32:06','D','2015-09-03 22:26:14','N'),('2015-oklahoma','20150902D0002','nicoline','20150902','Queen Wilhelmina State Park, Ark','We had planned a day for visiting Little Rock, but we ended up staying only an few hours, because it was so hot and humid that it made walking around an ordeal.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We started by visiting Little Rock Central High, scene of the infamous 1957 desegregation struggle. To my surprise it&apos;s still a working high school, so it wasn&apos;t possible to visit the building itself. But the National Park Service has a visitors center less than a block from the school where we could see and hear some  background material. I was disappointed, though, that they linked the struggle for women&apos;s rights and farm laborers right with the larger civil rights struggle, but not the fight for LGBT rights. I suppose that&apos;s still a bridge too far. Let&apos;s just hope that it won&apos;t come to sending in the 101st Airborne to enforce the Hodges v. Obergefell ruling...

So we found a parking garage  so as to leave the car in the shade, and set out to explore the River Walk, an area along the waterfront much favored by artists &amp; restaurants. We did walk across Junction Bridge over the Arkansas, a former railroad bridge that now provides a walkway between Little Rock and North Little Rock. But it was really too hot to do much walking. Even right next to and over the water it was too hot and sticky to be enjoyable.

But Arkansas is in a whole different league. We went back to the car and drove out of the city as fast as traffic and speed limits allowed, and it was just about bearable driving at 60 mph with all windows rolled down.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The heat didn&apos;t let up late in the afternoon, either, so when we got to the town of Dardanelle, just south of I-40, which I had wanted to visit because it&apos;s named for the approach to Istanbul from the Mediterranean and this year is the centenary of the Dardanelles campaign of World War I, we decided to stay in the car and drive down some scenic byways down toward the town of Mena. We noticed that Arkansas seems to be very worried about evacution in case of nuclear war... We thought we&apos;d find a place for the night somewhere close by, but then we had the brainwave of seeing if the lodge at Queen Wilhelmina state park had any vacancies. They did, but at such steep rates that we thought we&apos;d camp there instead.

The tribes tried to fight back in 1905 by proposing to form the state of Sequoyah in what is now the eastern half of Oklahoma, but President Theodore Roosevelt refused to consider anything but a unitary state, and so the Sequoyah plan floundered and Oklahoma became a state in 1907.

I did find out a lot of stuff about the  Cherokee nation in general and its capital Tahlequa in particular, but I don&apos;t  remember coming across any mention of Labor Day weekend as their big national heritage weekend. Which is something they&apos;re rightly proud of. The Cherokee had an alphabet by the early 1820s, developed by a linguistically gifted tribe member best known by the name of Sequoyah. They began publishing a newspaper by the late 1820s, opened schools and had a higher literacy rate than surrounding white communities. Many even converted to Christianity, and adopted laws based on American versions thereof. In short, they did everything that could reasonably have been expected of them, but there was nothing they could do against the greed and racist superiority ideas of their American neighbors and they fell victim to a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.

Driving into Tulsa, we saw a church called \"Abundant Rain\" something-or-other church. No one would ever name a North Carolina church that. If anything, they&apos;d pray that the rain be considerably less abundant than it sometimes is, I&apos;m sure.

(Some apparently hadn&apos;t been taught proper manners and blithely went on talking during the invocation of the deity.) Maybe people really aren&apos;t as religious as they&apos;re sometimes portrayed.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The powwow was a whole new experience. I know there&apos;s one in Howard county every year, but for one reason or another we&apos;ve never gone to one. Anyway, I think we got a more authentic experience than we would get in West Friendship by attending it right in the Cherokee capital, on Cherokee heritage weekend. It was certainly very colorful.

After all, this is vacation, which is supposed to be relaxing, not stressing.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We originally planned today to come to Tahlequah in the morning, see the sights, then head towards Tulsa in the afternoon. But when we arrived at the visitor center, we learned that today and tomorrow [20150904-104002] are the Cherokee National Holiday (always Labor Day weekend), and that as part of the celebrations, there would be an intertribal pow-wow in the afternoon. So we changed our plans: we are going to hang around for the pow-wow and worry about finding a place to sleep later.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We start by exploring Tahlequah on foot, walking past the Cherokee Nation courthouse (which was in operation, not a museum), visiting the Cherokee National Supreme Court Museum. Here we learned about the importance of the Cherokee syllabic alphabet, and how Cherokee language newspapers helped maintain the Cherokee identity. [20150904-095558]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We walked further up and down the town center, which is not that different for many other American towns (Tahlequah was voted one of America&apos;s 100 \"main street America\" towns), except that the street signs are both in English and in Cherokee. [20150904-110004]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In one of the shops we chat with the artist and Nicoline buys one of the T-shirts (red, of course) with the town name in both the Latin and the Cherokee alphabet.

There was no entrance fee to the heritage center (because of the Cherokee National Holiday) and we did get a canvas bag with, among other things, a cardboard fan printed with the logo of the National Holiday.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150904-123948] [20150904-125746] [20150904-131325] [20150904-134748]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Did I mention before that it was hot? Well, it was and continues to be 90s (Fahrenheit), although not as humid as we&apos;d get in Baltimore (or even in Little Rock). I find the heat bearable outside of the cities, but in urban areas, with the concrete and asphalt that radiates much of the heat back, it&apos;s tough.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150904-144827] We arrive at the pow-wow site before three, even though the program isn&apos;t supposed to start until five, and the main event (the \"grand entree\") won&apos;t be until seven. So we get out our folding chairs and relax some more - read a book, eat a snack, that kind of thing. As I said, it is important not to be running around all the time, but also allow time to sit back, close your eyes, and enjoy the quiet.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150904-160026] The pow-wow area is a circular area, marked off with benches on which I guess the different clans display their clan colors with blankets.

From the description, it seems they are mostly competitions in different categories - kind of like a county fair. But it was already getting close to eight and we knew there was not a single hotel room to  be found in the vicinity of Tahlequah.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We drove back, past Muskogee and Wagoner (where the last room in a hotel was booked over the Internet as I was standing at the desk, asking if they had any rooms left). We have had some bad experiences with non-chain motels, so we really wanted a national chain, and as it was getting past 10 by the time we reached the Tulsa area, we settled for a Holiday Inn which was more expensive than we&apos;d normally like.','2015-09-05 23:52:20','D','2015-09-05 23:13:36','N'),('2015-oklahoma','20150905D0001','eric','20150905','Tulsa, Oklahoma','[20150905-083407] The Holiday Inn may have been expensive, but they did offer an outside terrace for breakfast.

I have heard of him, of course, but never got a clear idea of who he was and why he was important. Obviously, this has been rectified: he not only has written songs like \"This land is your land\", but also was socially active in his song writing, during the dust bowl and beyond.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150905-122748] From the Guthrie Center we went to the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park, which was constructed 80 years after the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot. It \"tells the story of the African Americans&apos; role in building Oklahoma\". &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150905-131549] We now drive south, past a Route 66 display to Glenpool, where there is a monument to the Oklahoma oil business.

We didn&apos;t get there until 10:30 because Eric wanted to finish processing yesterday&apos;s powwow pictures first, and we also took some time over breakfast because the hotel had a nice little patio area adjacent to the breakfast room. Granted, the view was of US 51, but it was lovely to have breakfast outdoors. For unfathomable reasons, none of the 547 travel soccer team parents and/or their kids wanted to sit there... go figure :-) [20150905-084508]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Guthrie Center is well worth your time, should you ever find yourself in Tulsa. Did you know he was named for Woodrow Wilson, who was not yet elected president at the time of his birth? Though he&apos;s been known as Woody Guthrie ever since he was a little kid, his full name was actually Woodrow Wilson Guthrie. His influence on American music endures to the present, nearly 50 years after his untimely death from Huntington&apos;s disease. When you go through the short informational videos about his childhood and early life, you get the sense that the family endured more than its fair share of tragedy: the family home burned down, his older sister burned to death when her dress caught fire and Guthrie senior also fell victim to burning, though he survived. They didn&apos;t figure out until some years later that those fires weren&apos;t accidents, but caused by Woody&apos;s mom, in what may have been manifestations of the same disease that later killed him. She ended up being confined to an insane asylum. In the case of the elder Guthrie the fire that burned him may have been karma. When Woody was about 5, his father took part in a lynching in Okemah. According to Wiki, it was one of 147 lynchings that took place in Oklahoma between 1885 and 1930. [20150905-102804] [20150905-102900] [20150905-103220] [20150905-105604] [20150905-105705] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;More karmic justice may be at work in that the Guthrie Center is located two blocks fro the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park that commemorates the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot. It began when a young white woman accused a black young man, of either grabbing her to stop himself from falling, touching her inappropriately while she was a passenger on the elevator he operated, or assaulting her outright.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The accounts of the accident vary, but it sparked a race riot that laid waste to the Greenwood section of Tulsa, which was home to a well-to-do black middle class. It is quite possible that greed and jealousy had as much to do with the riot as the black boy touching (assaulting?) a white girl, because the Greenwood district of Tulsa was known as the black Wall Street. The number of people killed also varies considerably, from 39 to 300, with thousands left homeless and business, schools, churches, and the local hospital destroyed. [20150905-122543] [20150905-123611]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The great historian John Hope Franklin, whose family lived in Tulsa at the time of the riot, has devoted great effort to improving race relations, through his scholarly work and also by creating the John Hope Franklin Center for Reconciliation and the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park. Below are some pictures of the park, with its famous tower that gives an overview of the contribution black people have made and continue to make to Oklahoma.

It&apos;s rather a modest monument to a substance that has changed America as profoundly as oil.

That allowed me to park safely, if probably illegally, at a monument to Route 66 on Southwestern Boulevard, before heading to Cheyenne and 18th street to see the Creek Council Oak. It is said to be the spot where the very first settlement of what later became Tulsa took place at the western end of the Trail of Tears.

We made an effort to explore the city at least a little, and we did see some cool murals, but it was 95 degrees and I once again developed a skin rash that has a terrible-sounding name, but is really harmless apart from an absolutely infuriating itch!

You may want to read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia article</a> for more details, but there really are two parts that fixed Route 66 in the American psyche. First, during the depression and dust bowl, the US-66 was a major path for desperate people in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico to migrate to California to find work. Second, when the American middle class discovered vacations after the second World War, Route 66 was a popular route to reach California.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It is mostly from this second period, the one made famous by the \"Get your kicks on Route 66\" song), [20150906-124404] than many of the famous Route 66 landmarks originate. They were created by entrepreneurs who tried to attract tourists with clever and outlandish displays.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Few of these displays have survived the decline of the route, which started when the Interstates took over the role of primary travel lanes. [20150906-144745] But some new ones have also been added, like the \"pop\" (soda) bottle, in Arcadia. It is at a gas station and sells hundreds and hundreds of different types of soda.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150906-144750] [20150906-144650] [20150906-145102] [20150906-145133] [20150906-145233]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We wanted to visit [20150906-130240] the Route 66 Interpretative Center in Chandler, which didn&apos;t open until 1pm on a Sunday. Which was a bit of a problem, as it wasn&apos;t even 11 yet by the time we got to Chandler. So we decided to hang around, enjoying a donut and coffee (we have previously noticed what seems a relatively large number of donut shops in Oklahoma), and driving around town a bit.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150906-125844] Here we see our first residential solar panel. A day or two ago I realized that I haven&apos;t seen any residential solar panels at all here, even though the climate would be much better suited for solar panels than Maryland (where you see them all over the place nowadays). So I started to pay attention, and today we finally saw some solar panels. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, when the interpretative center finally opened it was somewhat interesting. They had sections arranged as seats in a car or beds in a motel from where to watch different video presentations.

It&apos;s only about a hundred miles or so, but since we took our time and had to wait in the town of Chandler for the Route 66 Interpretive Center (housed in a former National Guard armory, built under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration in 1937) to open, it took us the better part of today. But that&apos;s okay; vacation isn&apos;t about getting from A to B the fastest, but about enjoying the trip.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;And we sure did! We listened to our new Woody Guthrie CD and sang along as best we could to \"This Land Is Your Land.\" That song really ought to be the national anthem!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Route 66 isn&apos;t always the prettiest, but it&apos;s a fun drive, especially on a Sunday morning when there&apos;s nary a soul on the road. Tulsa, in particular, was virtually deserted. It wasn&apos;t until after we neared Oklahoma City that the roads became busier, but even the state&apos;s capital, which is comparable to Baltimore City in terms of population  (620K vs. 622K, respectively), was almost eerily empty. Maybe it was a big OSU football weekend? Football seems to be hugely important here. [20150906-090553] [20150906-090214]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself. As I said, we had some time to kill in  Chandler before the center opened, so we treated ourselves to coffee and doughnuts. Those were the best doughnuts I&apos;ve had in years! It&apos;s a shame you can&apos;t find decent doughnuts anywhere in Howard county since they closed the Krispy Kreme on Snowden River Parkway in the depths of the anti-carb craze. [20150906-140443] [20150906-105023]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To be honest, the interpretive center was not that interesting, but it did have a gift shop where we found a bumper sticker that Eric insisted on adding to the growing collection immediately.

I have no idea why anyone would build a round barn instead of the more common square or rectangular versions. Perhaps it deflects tornadoes better? [20150906-144228]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Soda Bottle place, appropriately named \"Pops\" was unexpectedly busy. After seeing so few people on the road, we have no explanation for why that place was filled to overflowing. People were waiting to get in the door, and inside it was an absolute zoo. It was kind of cool to see the giant soda bottle out front and their huge selection of sodas from all over the world, but we had no desire to wait in line for a peanut butter-jelly or a maple syrup flavored soda, so we just looked around, took some pictures, and continued on our way.

But once we&apos;d gone through security (which did not object to a full water bottle, which I think is a big no-no in Annapolis) we were free to wander through the building as we pleased and take pictures wherever we wanted, as long as it was without flash. [20150907-094250]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Oklahoma&apos;s capitol must be the only one in the nation to be built atop an oilfield. It&apos;s defunct now, but it was active when they began building it in 1910 and it continued to be so when it was opened in 1917. The constitution that Oklahoma Territory submitted prior to being admitted to the union in 1907 was extremely progressive and attempted to deal with corporate malfeasance in considerable detail. In those days apparently railroads were the most notorious offenders. It was the amount of detail that led William Howard Taft, then Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s Secretary of War and later president and Supreme Court justice, to campaign against it. [20150907-100413] [20150907-100601] [20150907-101244]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So it wasn&apos;t a question of the oil industry or any business interest calling the shots from the get-go, though you&apos;d never know it if you look around the capitol today. Corporate sponsorship is everywhere, and the oil industry features quite prominently, and not just on the capitol dome either. The dome wasn&apos;t added until 2002. The original building plans did call for one to be added, and also a structure that looked suspiciously like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but the money ran out. Why they didn&apos;t time adding the dome to coincide with the centennial is a mystery, since people are usually big on that sort of thing here. They did add a Ten Comandments monument in 2012. [20150907-102059] [20150907-100839]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At the capitol we met a guy from Honduras who put our effort to tic off states from our bucket list to shame. He&apos;s on a four month tour to all 50 states, and he had a \"passport\" that he got stamped in every single state capital. Except Oklahoma, because apparently the Visitor Center is the only place where he could get it, and it was closed for Labor Day. That&apos;s a bummer! But I did take his picture standing next to a floor mosaic of the great seal of the state of Oklahoma, so that proves he really was there. [20150907-105544]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the capitol it was only a short hop to the history museum, but corporate sponsorship is omnipresent at the Oklahoma History Center. OK, I realize oil and gas exploration, not to say exploitation, is huge in this state, but there&apos;s no need to club people over the head with it, all right? And how are you going to have a history center that doesn&apos;t even mention the land rush or the dust bowl? In fact, a series of reproductions of postcards sold at the Chicago World Fair of 1893 tell the story of the 46th state better than the History Museum, and that is just sad. Given their subject matter, some must have been produced for later fairs, but still.

Unfortunately, it seems that opinion is divided as to what, exactly, is the west.

Well, it is <em>hot.</em> Yesterday we saw a temperature display at a bank saying 101 degrees, today one at a church with 104. That&apos;s still around 40 degrees Centigrade. Even allowing for these displays to be inaccurate, it is still seriously hot. So we were happy to do a number of indoor things today.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-090943] First, the memorial of the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. No visit to Oklahoma City would be complete without it, although we skipped the accompanying museum. I&apos;m sorry, it may be unfeeling of me, but I keep thinking about the thousands, tens of thousands of people who have died as a result of random violence in the past twenty years. I realize the significance of the Oklahoma City bombing as an unprecedented act of domestic terrorism in the U.S. But maybe we need to talk more about the continuing acts of random terrorism occurring in this country?&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-092020] The memorial is impressive, I agree with that. What made it even more impressive were the totally empty streets around it. It is Labor Day today, so just about all offices downtown are closed. But the empty streets, at 9 a.m. on a Monday morning, were almost creepy, as if the end of the world had arrived.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-092043] [20150907-091914] [20150907-092510] [20150907-092818]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-094250] Next step today is the Oklahoma State Capitol. Surprisingly, the building is open (even though it is as deserted as downtown&apos;s streets). There were no tours available (the volunteer-run visitor center was closed) so the guards suggested we start at the fifth floor work our way down from there.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-095608] The entrance was actually in the basement, and to get to the elevator we had to pass through corridors with tableaux of Oklahoma hung on the walls. Interestingly enough, these paintings and those elsewhere in the Capitol ended up giving us a better overview of the Oklahoma history than Oklahoma Historical Society museum. Some highlights:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-095933] The oil industry. I knew oil was big in Oklahoma, but nothing brought that home like this painting, with the view from the capitol steps. Oklahoma City was actually a whole oil field! Some more oil-related pictures:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-095720] [20150907-095620] [20150907-095826]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-095508] The land run. This is how the Western settlement in Oklahoma, which was originally supposed to be Indian territory, started. On that first day, the town of Guthrie (the first capital of Oklahoma) went from zero to ten thousand people. In one day! The Wikipedia article mentions that a few months later it had city water, electricity, a mass transit system and <em>underground parking garages for horses and carriages</em>. That was in 1889!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-101109] The Bison, which is Oklahoma&apos;s state animal, and which was hunted almost to extinction in one of the early man-induced natural catastrophes in the United States (I didn&apos;t see any reference to the second great man-induced catastrophe, the Dust Bowl).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-101608] Ralph Ellison, who wrote <em>Invisible Man</em> and other acclaimed works.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-102232] Woody Guthrie. We learned all about him in the Woody Guthrie center in Tulsa, yesterday.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-103237] Steamboats on the Red River, from a time when the rivers were the main arteries of the country and the boats going up and down them the main mode of transportation. The Mississippi and its network of tributaries were what made the development of the large parts of the Midwest possible.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-103428] The California Road, back when there were no real roads. Where the rivers were the main arteries, horse-drawn carriages formed the byways. Wagon trains crossed the country, crossed the mountains, and brought settlers with all their possessions in the new lands.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-102059] Beyond the artwork, the capitol building itself is a beautiful building, with a majestic dome in the middle, and great rooms for the House of Representatives and Senate. All of which we could wander through freely, without anyone asking us what we were doing.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-100413] [20150907-100601] [20150907-101244] [20150907-101738] [20150907-102518]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-114259] After the state capitol, we went to the nearby museum of the Oklahoma Historical Society. The museum is housed in a big, beautiful building, but it didn&apos;t quite give a well-rounded view of the Oklahoma history.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-113103] The museum does have some interesting displays of oil-drilling equipment outside (we didn&apos;t spend a long time with that display, due to the heat). I always thought that wells were drilled with a drill that rotates, much like the electric drill I have in my toolbox.  It turns out that at least the earlier wells were drilled by basically hammering the rock to dust and then hoisting the rubble out. Who knew?&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-115939] Inside the museum, the display on Indian history was interesting, although of course we had already seen a lot of that. One thing of note was a willow backrest, because that features in the audio book \"Centennial\" we&apos;re listening to when we&apos;re on the road.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-121351] The 1951 Studebaker on display would fit very well with the Route-66 theme we had going yesterday. These <em>were</em> good looking cars they had back then...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-145738] The final stop today was the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum. By this time, we were tired, and we&apos;ve never been much into the whole cowboy-and-western thing anyway. But obviously this is a big part of what Oklahoma is, so we felt we had to investigate.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To me, the most interesting part was the \"Prosperity Junction\" section, an indoors replica of a turn-of-the-century (previous century, that is) cattle town. The town is displayed how it looks at night, which was pretty neat. I was grateful for my new camera, which make it possible to get some decent pictures even though it was very dark!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-143907] [20150907-143935] [20150907-143958] [20150907-144046]','2015-09-08 01:07:11','D','2015-09-08 01:02:03','N'),('2015-oklahoma','20150908D0001','nicoline','20150908','Lawton, Okla.','Knowing a little history has its uses. For example, when you&apos;re looking for a historic military base in a town that doesn&apos;t believe in providing signage, but you come across a street that&apos;s named for its first commander. Lawton/Ft. Sill: zero; me: one. [20150908-145454]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As it happens, Gen. Phil Sheridan wasn&apos;t Fort Sill&apos;s first commander. I learned today that that was actually Gen. Grierson, and that Sheridan was \"only\" the guy who found the site on which the fort has been located since 1869. He named it for one of his West Point classmates who had been killed in the Civil War. [20150908-153831] [20150908-150900] [20150908-151950]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I didn&apos;t expect historic Fort Sill to be part of an active military installation, either. But it&apos;s in a rather remote corner of the base, making it necessary to go to an actual background check to get a one day pass. If you have a felony conviction or are on a sex offenders register, you are out of luck. Good thing Eric and I are such law-abiding citizens, or we couldn&apos;t have visited the museum, housed in the original barracks, or Geronimo&apos;s grave. The Apache chief, who hated Mexicans and Americans equally, was captured during the Indian Wars in 1886 and lived out the remainder of his life as a prisoner of war, until his death in 1909 at Ft. Sill. Some of his family members are also buried there. [20150908-155513][20150908-155603] [20150908-155745]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We had continued our quest to soak up a little cowboy &amp; western heritage today. After seeing a whole museum dedicated to it, we wanted to see for ourselves what the land where it all happened took place. Of course, little actual prairie is left nowadays. I read somewhere that only about 10% of what used to be an immense sea of tall grass prairie remains. But US 81 between Yukon, just west of Oklahoma City, and Duncan, Okla. about 50 miles southeast of the city, pretty much follows the Chisholm Trail. So we drove down to Duncan to visit the Chisholm Trail Heritage Center, where they showed a movie that recreated a cattle drive  complete with sound and tactile effects, such as getting sprinkled with a little water during an on-screen thunderstorm.

Well, of course, nothing is ever *little* in Texas, so we drove a good extra hour to Wichita Falls and from there back north up the same US routes to get to our Oklahoma destination.

A good thing we did, too, because we got caught in a downpour even before we&apos;d left the base. But we did get a picture of a traffic sign warning about a \"Howitzer Crossing.\" That is just not the kind of thing we&apos;re ever warned about in suburban Maryland.

We only drink from one of the bottles, then refill it from the others. That way, only one bottle has to be cleaned every night. The water is cooled in the hotel room fridge over night, so the cooler stays a little bit cool. Also on the back seat, the box with \"stuff\" (you always need a \"stuff\" box with the different odds and ends) and my camera bag.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150908-073720] In the front we have a USB spider from which we charge Nicoline&apos;s phone and tablet, as well as my camera&apos;s GPS, and a Bluetooth speaker.

We have a couple of places on our list related to the Chisholm Trail that we&apos;d like to seek out.

An entrepreneur built a  big stockyard in Abilene, Kansas, and encouraged Texas ranchers to drive their cattle there, from where they would be shipped by train to the East. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150908-113145] [20150908-113206] [20150908-113225]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150908-110941] The \"Chisholm Trail\", named after a trader who had several trading posts in \"Indian country\" (now Oklahoma) and mapped a route between them, was used by the cowboys coming from many different feeder trails in Texas to get through the \"wild west\" of Oklahoma to Kansas. So the map at the heritage center is actually a bit misleading.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150908-115835] In Duncan we also come across what looks like a real modern-day cowboy: a guy riding his horse through the streets.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150908-121335] We continue our way through the town of Comanche and decide to take a little detour through Texas, since we&apos;re so close anyway.

You have to realize that this part of the refuge is labeled the \"wilderness area\" meaning that the trail, although well maintained, is not marked in any way, and the area off the trail doesn&apos;t look very different from the area on the trail.

The climb was strenuous, but doable, and the views from atop the mountain were breathtaking.&lf;&nl;[20150909-090342] [20150909-091736] [20150909-092720] [20150909-095816] [20150909-100214] [20150909-100247] [20150909-100525] [20150909-101103] [20150909-103233] [20150909-103337] [20150909-105116] [20150909-111714] [20150909-113338] [20150909-114750] [20150909-115417] [20150909-115433] [20150909-115613] [20150909-120919]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But then came the descent. At first we did well, and went down the path at a fairly good clip. But at some point we wandered down a side trail without realizing it, and just keep on hiking down until we&apos;d tried three or four different ways of getting back to the path, but hitting enormous boulder-strewn fields too steep and dangerous to hike down without climbing gear.

Phew!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then we drove back to the visitor center, because it had exhibits on both the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, both did a lot of great work in the 1930s to improve the park. We had wanted to see those, but the visitor center lady suggested that we hike first, while the weather was still cool and pleasant (it was overcast and maybe in the upper 70s when we started) and see the exhibit afterward.

Our days always start with breakfast. Normally, the hotels / motels we visit offer complementary breakfast (this didn&apos;t use to be the case, but is quite common now). Our Days Inn in Elk City, though, had a novel variation of this: they offered vouchers for the Mexican restaurant next door (actually, in the same building) for breakfast. The restaurant breakfast did not have any options, but it was good nonetheless, so this works as well.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150910-081351] After breakfast we visited the National Route 66 Museum. That is, we didn&apos;t go into the museum proper (for one thing, it didn&apos;t open until 9, and we were there 8:15), but walked around the grounds. This wasn&apos;t just Route 66 specific either, more general about pioneer times.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150910-081735] [20150910-081941] [20150910-082022] [20150910-082046] [20150910-082611] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150910-083114] When we were looking at some of the displays in front of the blacksmith shop, the man who runs that particular area drove up and opened it up for us. He was a retired farmer who was interested in collecting and restoring blacksmith equipment, and gave us a tour of the display. He showed us some of the things that students in the blacksmith class make, and it&apos;s quite fascinating to see how they can turn old railroad ties and rusty rasps into decorative items.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150910-082827] [20150910-083453] [20150910-083400] [20150910-085304] [20150910-085426]  [20150910-085828] [20150910-090056]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Route 66 museum came the Washita battlefield, after which we continued to the Glass Mountains.

This is something I always wanted to do (doesn&apos;t everybody who sees one of these rocks stick up in the landscape want to climb them) so in spite of the heat and the burning sun there was no holding me back :-).

We were walking around the parts of the Route 66/Pioneer Village museum that are accessible outside opening hours and were admiring the blacksmithing work on display there when the guy who runs the blacksmith shop as a museum volunteer drove up. He saw us admiring the work, and offered to give us a private tour. He told us that he&apos;d begun  to make Route 66 branding irons, just like the cattle branding irons ranchers still use and sent them to Texas with someone he knew to see if anyone was interested. Wouldn&apos;t you know it, they liked the idea, but thought the 3x5\" brand too small. So now he&apos;s going to make great big ones for the Texas market, and gave us a piece of wood that he&apos;d tried the small iron on. Now there&apos;s a one-of-a-kind keepsake!

The place was so peaceful, with no sound other than the buzzing of insects and the rustling of tall grass, that it hardly seemed possible a blood bath took place here. Native Americans have religious services there and leave prayer flags, which the Park Service asks visitors not to photograph, as this is considered disrespectful. It is a place where you feel deeply ashamed to be white.

I don&apos;t know how we always manage to do these thing during the hottest hours of the day, but Eric had particularly wanted to go up on Glass (aka Gloss) Mountain, and it took us a good two hours to drive there, so up we went. Glass Mountain is named that for visible deposits of selenite that give the impression of pieces of glass embedded in the stone. I suppose that was our Stairmaster workout for the day,  though why the Oklahoma State Parks department didn&apos;t see fit to extend the stairway all the way up is beyond me.

But we came across two stone markers at the Beaver county line explaining some of the history of No Man&apos;s Land, and then we noticed on the map that there was a \"Gateway to the Panhandle Museum\" in the appropriately named town called Gate, so that we decided to take the 20 mile or so detour and see if we could visit.

Mrs. Karen Bond, as we later learned she was called, was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the history of Gate and No Man&apos;s Land. [20150911-114736] [20150911-141903] [20150911-141921][20150911-141937]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;For example, the existence of a strip of No Man&apos;s Land didn&apos;t come about by accident. It was done so that Texas would not have to enter the union as a free state, because if that strip had come with Texas, it would have put the state line north of the 36Â°30\" line delineated by the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which forbade slavery above that line. Obviously, Texas couldn&apos;t be part free, part slave state, and the southern border of the free state Kansas had already been fixed at 37Â° latitude. But since Oklahoma was still Indian Territory at that time, Congress was content to leave a part of the country without any kind of government, state or federal, at all.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Mrs. Bond told us that back in those days, whatever authority there was was of the vigilante type. At one time, a guy with a few horses came into Neutral City, a town west of Gate, and the people were convinced that he&apos;d stolen the horses. So they strung him up from the hanging tree, the remains of which reside in the museum (it was hit by lightening). However, the man&apos;s family, which lived in Texas, found out about the hanging, and as he really had owned the horses, they got together a posse, rode over Neutral City and burned the town to the ground. There&apos;s supposed to be a historic marker on the spot where the town stood along US 64, but we never found it. Cattle rustlers, counterfeiters, horse thieves, bootleggers, outlaws of every description: No Man&apos;s Land had them all. [20150911-113137]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Afficionados of the comic \"Lucky Luke\" will be pleased to learn that one of the notorious Dalton brothers once rode up to a local ranch, and asked for lodging for the night, which he got on the condition that he turn over his guns for safekeeping. The next morning he got them back, and the stranger rode away, followed after a little while by a posse in hot pursuit of one of the Daltons who was wanted for robbery.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;All this sounds kind of funny and confirms to most people&apos;s romantic notions of the Wild West, but for the people who moved there trying to make an honest living by farming or ranching, it cannot have been very amusing. For one thing, it meant that it was impossible to gain title to their land, because there was no authority with which to file a claim. But even after No Man&apos;s Land was placed under the jurisdiction of a federal court in Paris, Texas, when Oklahoma territory was opened to white settlement in 1889, people continued to have problems with the law. The court was supposed to deal only with felony cases, but federal marshals began to arrest people for even minor infractions, the better to earn the fees they got for arresting people.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Quite a part from legal problems, the people who homesteaded or otherwise laid  claim to land in the Panhandle had plenty of trouble making a go of farming or ranching. As we learned at the Oklahoma University No Man&apos;s Land Museum in Goodwell, the region is semi-arid and prone to drought, so that crop failures are not uncommon. And when periods of extreme drought combine with severe economic distress, as they did during the 1920s and 1930s, it can be life-threateningly difficult to hang on. In fact, during the Dust Bowl years, many people didn&apos;t survive because the very air poisoned them. The topsoil dust clouds contained silica, which gave some people a lung disease similar to Black Lung in miners. [20150911-111729] [20150911-140317] [20150911-140741][20150911-110728]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;According to Mrs. Bond, those were also the years when the town of Gate first began to decline. In the early 20th century, it was a town of about 1,000 people with its own school system, a library, a post office, two grocery stores, a bank, and a railway station one one of the Katy branch lines. Gradually, people began to move away, until today the town is down to 100 inhabitants, and not much in the way of amenities. The railroad shut down in the 1950s and the elementary school closed its doors in 1991. The bank&apos;s vault is now the Parks &amp; Recreation building in the town&apos;s small park, and the railroad depot is home to the museum. Just as Wall Street and the financial sector put the economic thumb crews to people nowadays, so they did in the 1930s. In sixty percent of land abandonment cases, this was caused by foreclosure, not by farmers giving up on account of the drought. Plus Ã§a change, plus c&apos;est la mÃªme chose....

These concepts are hard to take seriously when you live in a city or suburb on the East Coast, in a society that is so complex and intertwined that everyone relies on so many different aspects of government and laws that it is impossible to imagine a society without them.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Things are different in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Up to 125 years ago, this area literally did not have any government or laws. The United States laws did not apply here, nor did the laws of any of the states or territories. The only law that existed was what the pioneers here made it to be. If neighbors agreed that someone should be shot or hanged, that was it. To this day the panhandle has as its nickname \"No Man&apos;s Land.\"&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The reason for this strange state is mostly an accident of history. When Texas became a state, it should logically have extended up to the border with Kansas, at the 37th parallel. However, due to the Missouri Compromise, any state above the 36Â° 30&apos; parallel would have to be a \"free state\" and Texas would only join the union as a slave state. So Texas&apos; northern border was at the 36Â° 30&apos; parallel. This left a strip of land 166 miles long and 34 miles wide that was not part of any state or territory. No man&apos;s land. Inhabited by individuals who did not want or need government. One of the few areas in the United States where people come by the \"minimal government\" ideas honestly.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150911-104020] We start our tour of the panhandle at the <em>Gateway to the Panhandle Museum</em> in the town of Gate.

Adding to the confusion, there had been road signs to both the summit and the preserve, but at the parking entrance there was only a sign to the preserve. So we got to make a little detour on dirt roads into Colorado.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150912-093224] Anyway, we finally make it to the trail head, and start hiking. It is 4.2 miles one way to the summit, which includes a climb up the mesa.

There is an enormous amount of insects (crickets, grass hoppers, beetles, some butterflies), all of which are too fast to be captured properly. One type of them looks like a cricket when it&apos;s sitting, looks like an orange/brown butterfly when it&apos;s flying, and sounds like a rattle snake.

On the way over we came upon a historical marker for the Santa Fe trail that used to run through here from the 1820s to the 1860s, until the railroad made it obsolete. Imagine traveling that trail for weeks on end, covering maybe 12 miles a day or so. The more I see of this country, the more I wonder what kind of people these explorers, traders, and pioneers were and what possessed them to undertake such journeys.

We do stop at the various welcome centers, to pick up an updated state highway map (if we don&apos;t need them now, they&apos;re bound to become handy for some future trip) and to look for ideas of things to visit. Even though we&apos;re homeward bound, we don&apos;t want to just drive Interstate, so we do look for side trips.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-123848] Our side trip today is to Fulton, one of the places we skipped on our 2012 I-70 trip. Fulton is where Winston Churchill held his famous \"Iron Curtain\" speech in 1946, and the location of the \"National Churchill Museum\". &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-130529] The Churchill museum consists of three parts. The first part is an exhibition about the life of Churchill, and I found it to be quite well done. I got a better understanding how the different parts of Churchill&apos;s life are connected from this exhibition.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-133436] Of course the \"Sinews of Peace\" speech (which is the official name of the Iron Curtain speech) features prominently, and even Marching Monkey was interested.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-135232] The second part is a memorial to Churchill in the form of a rescued church. Yes, for this memorial they collected the ruins of one of the London churches bombed out in the Blitz in 1940, shipped them to Fulton, and reconstructed the building here. It was unnaturally bright in the church, though, which makes me wonder whether the original may have have stained glass windows (this church had plate glass in its large windows).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-140528] The third part is a sculpture called \"Breakthrough\". It is made by Churchill&apos;s grand-daughter from sections of the Berlin Wall, out of which a male and a female figure are cut. It is almost eerie, having this sculpture representing the end of the Cold War at the museum inspired by the speech which was the first to recognize the start of the Cold War. At first I thought, what the heck, but after thinking about this I could see how it made sense to have this statue here.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-135732] After the museum we visited the actual spot where the speech was given. The only place large enough to hold the crowd that would come to hear Churchill speak (and see president Truman) was the university&apos;s gymnasium. It is still the university&apos;s gymnasium, with a little mark at the entrance remembering the world-famous event that took place here. It makes you wonder if the kids who play basketball here even realize what happened here in 1946.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-135828] [20150915-135840] [20150915-135952] [20150915-140014]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-141406] The lady at the chamber of commerce tourist information, where we stopped on our way into town, suggested Saults Drug Store, which has an old-fashioned soda fountain. We decided to have our ice cream lunch here today (we&apos;re on vacation, so we can celebrate!)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-141057] [20150915-141708] [20150915-142107]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150915-162306] After Fulton, where we ended up spending almost two and a half hours (much more than we intended) we continued through Missouri and well into Illinois before stopping at a Days Inn.

Since we&apos;d be driving past Columbus anyway, coming home on I-70, we figured arranging dinner with them would only make sense. Today worked with both of their schedules.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150916-083338] Since we went to sleep in Illinois, we had all of Indiana to cross today, and a bit under half of Ohio. Also, we switched back from Central to Eastern Time, so we lost an hour. Still, we were way early in Columbus, so we arranged a hotel first (on the east side of town, to give us a quick start tomorrow) and took a little bit of a nap before meeting with Mark and Jenny.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150916-171700] Mark suggested a place called \"bar 145\" which is named after the optimal temperature to cook a burger. The place provided little notes on which you could indicate the parts with which to make your own burger.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150916-172502] [20150916-172612] [20150916-173347] [20150916-174449] [20150916-180719]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150916-190851] After dinner we brought Mark and Jenny back to Mark&apos;s place and went back to the hotel, where we noticed that the bedside tables had electrical outlets built in. Those who travel may know that having enough electrical outlets to charge all devices is sometimes a challenge.

The museum is both about the National Road (which we explored in our 2012 I-70 vacation) and about Zane Grey, an author in the early 20th century whose stories were the basis for many westerns (movies). Personally, I really liked the displays with scenes of the National road.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150917-095956] [20150917-100125] [20150917-100220] [20150917-100721] [20150917-101639]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the museum we continued, having lunch in West Virginia near Morgantown, [20150917-135812] and then on to home.

It has been a packed few weeks, from leaving really early on Sunday, August 30, starting with the Space and Rocket Center in Alabama, then through Arkansas and Oklahoma, attending a Pow-Wow, climbing on top of two mesas, and returning via our good friend the I-70.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150907-095608] Oklahoma City stands out to me as a city of good neighbors. I&apos;ve never seen so many fences in any suburb! That, and the fact that they let us wander around the deserted state capitol by ourselves on a national holiday (Labor Day), with only a metal detector checkpoint when we got in. Be able to take photos everywhere. Don&apos;t expect anything like that in Annapolis or Washington D.C.!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150909-161420] We all know that Oklahoma is one of the big Oil States. Oil and oil companies have been a huge part of Oklahoma&apos;s past, illustrated by the fact that Oklahoma&apos;s capital was built on top of a huge oil field. So we were wondering if there would be much alternative energy in Oklahoma. Turns out there are huge wind farms, which makes sense given the proverbial never ending wind on the plains.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150906-125844] Solar energy, on the other hand, was virtually absent, which is something I cannot understand at all. We saw <em>one</em> house (well, a trailer actually) with solar panels. Just about the only other solar panels we saw were on &amp;mdash; wait for this &amp;mdash; oil and fracking installations. As if only Big Oil is allowed to use solar panels here!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Oklahoma seems to be a state that mostly stays by itself. We saw relatively few out-of-state license plates while driving around Oklahoma, and when we did, it was mostly from neighboring states (Texas, Arkansas). Conversely, we did not see a lot of cards with Oklahoma license plates before Western Arkansas or after Southern Colorado. Which may not be surprising, given the surprised looks we got over the past half year when we told people we were planning a road trip to Oklahoma. &amp;ldquo;Do you have family there&amp;rdquo; was a common response, as if there wouldn&apos;t be any other reason to visit the state.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20150910-150451] I think that this blog has shown that those people were wrong. Oklahoma is a beautiful, fascinating state. We feel as if we barely scratched the surface in the week and a half we were there. We originally had at least twice as many items on our \"potential\" list, and could have criss-crossed the state much more than we did. As it is, Oklahoma is definitely on our list of states to come back to!','2015-09-20 14:25:02','D','2015-09-20 14:12:15','N'),('2015-oklahoma','20150918D0002','nicoline','20150918','','If there&apos;s one thing I found in Oklahoma it&apos;s that it&apos;s a beautiful state, with a varied landscape, and no, it isn&apos;t flat.

Now we find that we may have neglected it to our detriment. We were there for nearly three weeks, and we&apos;ve barely scratched the surface. Definitely a place to go back to!  [20150909-140715]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One thing that struck me after we&apos;d left Oklahoma - and Arkansas and made our way back up north to catch I-70 in Colorado was that Colorado towns, in the main, looked like they had some economic life, a local cafÃ©, a gas station, a store of some kind.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In both Oklahoma and Arkansas we saw a lot of towns that were just a collection of houses, some in better shape than others. In Mississippi we even saw some where there the churches looked brand new, while the homes were hovels. [20150910-082848]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At the same time, it was at a hovel (a trailer) that we saw our only domestic solar panel array. Do you know where they have solar panels? On metering equipment for fracking installations! How&apos;s that for irony?&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I hasten to add that there are also large windmill parks, which is an excellent thing in a state that&apos;s so windy that I&apos;ve had to tie down my sun hat with a bandana to make it stay on my head!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Why Oklahoma doesn&apos;t make more of its unique heritage is a complete mystery to me. Cowboys &amp; Indians, what&apos;s not to like? Ask Massachusetts and Rhode Island for advice on how to gloss over the unsavory parts... No, seriously, who ever said that the only vacations are those you have in the mountains or the woods? The Great Plains is where it&apos;s at! We don&apos;t have space like this back East!

Welcome to the website we use when we&amp;rsquo;re traveling!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To be honest, one of the reasons I created this website is just because I can&amp;mdash;I am an Internet programmer by profession and maintaining my personal website is one of my hobbies. But I also created this site because we found during our 2007 two-month trip around the U.S. that it is fun to stay in touch with friends and family during a long trip. And more importantly we found in the years since that the diary of a trip is a wonderful electronic keepsake, one that we keep coming back to years later. So now I&amp;rsquo;m creating a site like this for every major vacation.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Another of my hobbies is photography which is why this website is also geared towards maintaining a photographic record of the trip. This means that I&apos;m planning to spend an hour or more every evening downloading photos from the camera to the laptop, sorting through, labeling and (if necessary) processing them, and finally posting the best ones on the website.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I sincerely hope that those of you reading this will have as much fun as we intend to have on the trip!','yes','2015-08-24 10:19:15','A','N'),('nicoline','Nicoline Smits','c81ec5458ada788171d58944c3e3659f','nicolinesmits@gmail.com','maint','cmamV','Eric and I love to travel, and we especially love long car trips.

No doubt worries about their safety and that of her half-brother and his sons contributed to that, but she led a difficult life. The information panel in the sod cabin at the Prairie Museum in Colby confirmed that the pioneer life was hardly a picnic: \"Loneliness and the stark landscape proved a struggle for many who were used to living in towns and among trees.\" And that&apos;s quite apart from the financial struggle, or the struggle to raise a crop.

We found the house, but there was a sign on the door saying it was closed until 2:00.

We had breakfast, said goodbye to the cats (exhorting them to be good; hope it helps. I&apos;m talking to you, Cleopatra!) Now that we don&apos;t have to worry about people in the back seat, we don&apos;t even bother trying to fit everything into the trunk, either. [20120512-063156] I had an extra cup of coffee and wouldn&apos;t you know it, I spilled half of it over my t-shirt. Great. But Eric absolutely wanted to take pictures in Breezewood, PA, and the ladies&apos; room at the Sheetz had a turbo hand-drying thing, so I used that to dry my shirt after I had rinse the coffee stains out. Good thing I don&apos;t take milk &amp; sugar in it. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On our way to Washington, PA the Quaker State again lived up to its reputation for Philly and Pittsburgh with Alabama in the middle. Plenty of billboards extolling the uses of coal as a clean energy source. Sure, and pigs can fly. Also billboards about politics and fracking. [20120512-105443] [20120512-113112]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One of the first things we came across in Washington, PA was the Center for Coalfield Justice, with one window showing an old picture of a group of miners and the other one had a display on fracking. There was a list of 175 different chemicals that they use to fracture the rocks to get at the gas deposits, none of them sounding very benign, plus a couple of bottles of water that comes from people&apos;s taps in fracked areas. [20120512-115900] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We had intended to visit the David Bradford House. [20120512-115752]Bradford was the leader of the whiskey rebellion in the 1790s, who fled to Spanish West-Florida (now Louisiana) after his role in the rebellion was exposed. He was later pardoned. [20120512-131348] But the Bradford house had a note on the door saying that they&apos;d be closed until 2 for an outreach program, so we kind of hung out in Washington for two hours. At 2 p.m. we knocked on the door, but still couldn&apos;t get an answer, so we gave up. Too bad. Maybe we&apos;ll come back some other time. We&apos;d also wanted to see the Francis Lemoyne House, but that&apos;s only open to the public from Tuesday through Friday. Stores have weird opening hours there, anyway. There&apos;s a liquor store next to the Bradford House that&apos;s only open on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. If you crave a stiff belt of whiskey on a Tuesday, tough luck. [20120512-135216]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Washington we double back to Beallsville, to see one of the \"Madonna of the Trail\" statues put up by the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, NSDAR. Rather an unfortunate abbreviation, I&apos;m afraid. The statue depicts a pioneer woman with two kids, a gun set down at her feet, looking resolutely westward. On one of the sides of the base it refers to a nice helpful Indian by the name of Nemacolin. Kind of like the Indians in Massachusetts who supposedly asked the English \"to come over and help [them].\" [20120512-145907] [20120512-150027] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Beallsville we drove to Pittsburgh. I conceived of the idea of finding lodging in a section of Pittsburgh called Carnegie, but unfortunately it did not boast of any hotels or motels. We drove around Pittsburgh for quite a while, until we finally found an Econolodge in Clairton, just south of Pittsburgh. With a king-size bed. I got online to get the address for the Duquesne Incline, thinking that I could just plug that into my nifty new GPS-enabled phone. Well, I could plug it in all right, but getting the directions was quite a different matter. It must be the mountainous terrain that makes it so difficult for Prudence to hang on to the signal. But we managed to find the incline all the same and rode it up to Grandview Street. [20120512-190701] [20120512-192519] People who live on the right side of the street have a grand view indeed![20120512-193039] [20120512-194559] It is also *the* area in Pittsburgh for prom and wedding pictures, judging by the number of parties with the gentlemen in suits &amp; ties and the ladies in fancy dresses and either completely flat shoes (think ballerina) or 6\" platform heels. There doesn&apos;t seem to be a middle way. I hadn&apos;t changed from my comfy driving outfit of workout pants, t-shirt (sans coffee stains) and sneakers, so I was a tad undressed for the fancy restaurants near the Duquesne Incline, but luckily the Monogahela Incline had some places where 6\" heels weren&apos;t required. I tried taking a few pictures of Pittsburgh&apos;s skyline by night with the camera in my phone, but it&apos;s hopeless. Having a photography nut for a husband has spoiled me for crappy pictures, I&apos;m afraid :-) [20120512-205629] [20120512-210402] [20120512-211852] [20120512-211915] [20120512-212013]','2012-05-13 12:54:49','D','2012-05-13 03:11:10','N'),('201205130001','eric','20120513','Nationality Rooms','We started today at the site of the Homestead Steel Strike, and in particular the location of the battle between the Pinkerton agents and the striking workers.

[20120513-125700] I find it hard to imagine coming here for classes every day, but I guess that is what is is there for.

Here we ran into an old \"S-bridge\", [20120513-162512] a bridge named that way because the road makes an \"S\" curve leading up to and coming off the bridge. They built bridges this way to keep the bridge itself cross the water at a right angle, making the bridge as short and cheap as possible.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We had dinner in our room with a bread that Nicoline had bought earlier today on a farmer&apos;s market and cream cheese in which was mixed some kind of powder (she can explain this better).

When the union&apos;s contract with Carnegie was due to expire, Carnegie told Frick to see to it that the union was kept out of the next contract, whereupon Frick hired 300 Pinkerton agents to prevent a lockout at the mill. When workers and their families got word that several barges with Pinkertons were on their way to the Homestead mill, they chose to meet them head on. The ensuing battle became known as the Homestead Riot. [20120513-100157] [20120513-100213] [20120513-102159] [20120513-094718]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Today, the pump house that was the site of the battle in 1892 is home to a farmers&apos; market. In one half of the building you can still see some of the pump house equipment and it holds an exhibit on the Homestead Strike, and the other half is home to a Sunday morning farmers&apos; market. Unfortunately, Eric was so fascinated by the photogenic qualities of old steel mill equipment that he completely forgot to take pictures of the farmers&apos; market. [20120513-100852] [20120513-095948] [20120513-100050] [20120513-101345] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Since today was Mother&apos;s Day and restaurants were likely to be packed wherever we went, I decided to buy some bread and scones and some cheese ball mix at the farmers&apos; market to have for dinner tonight. It was an inspired idea, if I do say so myself. We had slices of a rosemary-garlic focaccia with cheese spread (made with cream cheese) and a scone for dinner and it wasn&apos;t half bad! [20120513-182154] But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It had started to rain while we were looking around the pump house and it didn&apos;t look as though taking the walking tour to the original Homestead mill site, a little bit further west, was going to be an option. Besides, the Homestead site is now called the Waterfront and houses as choice a selection of corporate America as you find in any suburban strip mall. I saw a Costco, an AMC theater, a Best Buy, and a Target, to name but a few. Nothing at the Waterfront reminds of the Homestead Strike, of course. One historical marker mentioned the word \"Homestead\" but it was in reference to a Negro league baseball team that used to play there, the Homestead Grays. So we decided to drive around the Homestead Borough and we came across the cemetery where the seven striking workers who were killed during the Homestead Riot were buried. Unfortunately, there was no book or map or anything to help us figure out where their graves were, but the cemetery gave a nice overview of the cultural melting pot that is Pittsburgh. Many names recalled their owners&apos; German, Irish, Slavonic or Italian names. There was one clan of Irish folks who had a whole cluster of identically marked headstones, McMillan. I hated to see the cemetery had been vandalized recently. Somebody apparently thought it witty to drive a car over the graves, knocking over headstones and gouging deep ruts in the grass. [20120513-103827] We drove around the neighborhood near the cemetery, because we had seen an onion-domed church that had to mean an Eastern Orthodox church. It wasn&apos;t much too look at from the outside, but the inside was amazingly scrumptious. Lots of gold leaf, icons, and an elaborately painted cupola. The words that were part of the artwork must have been in church Slavonic. I could see that they were in Cyrillic script, but I couldn&apos;t make out any of the characters, and I can usually figure out words in Russian by figuring out each character separately. Since services were going on, Eric couldn&apos;t take pictures, but they let us join the congregation (no more than two dozen mostly elderly people) who had to stand for most of the time. I knew people had to stand during services in Eastern Orthodox churches in Europe, but I thought that it might be different here, since they do have pews. But they stood for most of the time we were there. [20120513-105605] [20120513-105640] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But you&apos;re still wondering about the connection to Frick. Let me put you out of your misery. We drove to the University of Pittsburgh to see the International Classrooms. They are a number of classrooms (about two dozen, I think) that various countries have donated to the university starting in the 1930s. The rooms are in a building called the Cathedral of Learning, a neo-gothic monstrosity of a building that reminded me of nothing so much as the Stalinist tower the people of Warsaw were forced to buy themselves as a \"present\" from the people of the USSR. It sits on the site that was formerly occupied by the Frick house, but Frick himself was long dead by the time his heirs endeavored to expiate his sins. [20120513-115435] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Some of the rooms are quite interesting, such as the English room, with chairs that used to stand in the House of Commons and the benches set up in the same pattern as the benches in the Commons. Having just listened to a biography of the Reagan-Thatcher political marriage, I had no trouble at all imagining the Iron Lady at Prime Minister&apos;s Question Time, taking questions from obstreperous back benchers and verbally tearing them to shreds. Of course, we had to sit and get our picture take in those chairs. [20120513-121259] Many of the rooms were exceedingly gloomy, and the weather didn&apos;t help much either. It was a great day for indoor sightseeing! I liked the Italian room, where the backs of all the chairs are carved with the name and year of the founding of Italian universities. The oldest one was at Bologna in 1088. Milan didn&apos;t get one until 1923! [20120513-124338]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Cathedral of Learning (really, even the name!) we drove along the National Historic Road to near Wheeling, West Virginia, where we are spending the night in a hotel with a great pool. We dutifully swam some laps, but I have to admit the hot tub was too tempting.

Driving in on US-40, we easily found West Virginia&apos;s copy of the Madonna of the Trail (won&apos;t bother with a photo of it here) in Wheeling Park. A little bit further we happened to stop at McColloch&apos;s Leap. Although I had read about this major in the Revolutionary war jumping over a cliff [20120514-103046] I hadn&apos;t expected to stop here. What made us stop was a statue of an Native American a few feet further down; looking around I noticed the marker of McColloch&apos;s Leap. Speak about an interesting juxtaposition of images... Anyway, the view at this point was impressive.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The second thing (after the Madonna) I wanted to see in Wheeling was the suspension bridge. [20120514-111751] When built in 1847 it was the largest bridge of its kind.

The visitors center couldn&apos;t tell us, but referred us to the public library, so Nicoline did some research in old newspapers to find that this had been in the McLure hotel. [20120514-122513] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We couldn&apos;t find the hotel at first so we sat down in a coffee shop [20120514-143148] (for the Dutch readers: a coffee shop here is a place where you actually buy coffee) where we had tea and a cookie, and sat down and relaxed for a bit. By the time it was 2:30 we continued onward into Ohio.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I had wanted to see [20120514-151515] a number of \"S\" bridges, which I had found on-line were still preserved in Ohio.

Finding the Madonnas of the Trail that commemorate that courage is fun, even if the statues themselves are exceedingly ugly. They remind me of the kind of art favored by dictators from both the left and the right. Both Hitler and Stalin loathed abstract, modern art. Hitler called it â€œentartetâ€ while Stalin and his cronies referred to it as â€œdecadent bourgeois art.â€ The Madonnas of the Trail predate both dictators by a few years, but itâ€™s the same kind of heroic, quasi-folksy art. All the same, the Wheeling madonna is set on the edge of Wheeling Park, a beautiful area, and markers explain how the State of West-Virginia came into being (during the Civil War) and that Wheelingâ€™s most famous Civil War-era resident, major-general Jesse L. Reno, was killed at the Battle of South Mountain in western Maryland. Weâ€™ve seen his battlefield memorial many times, as it is on the Appalachian Trail. Heâ€™s not buried there or in Wheeling, but in the Georgetown, Washington, D.C.&lf;&nl;[20120514-100708] [20120514-100012] [20120514-100111] [20120514-100330]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the madonna we drove on into Wheeling following U.S. 40 until we came upon a statue of an Indian. [20120514-102919] The local Kiwanis group donated this statue to the city of Wheeling in 1928. I suppose by 1928 what few Native Americans were still left in the area had no choice but to be friendly, unlike their 1777 counterparts. Less than 100 ft away from the Indian statue stands the memorial to the leap major Samuel McColloh made to escape a band of hostile Indians during the Revolutionary War, a leap of 300 ft. [20120514-103141] I looked down from the marker today and I find it very difficult to believe that he could have made that leap and lived to tell about it. [20120514-103428]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Still following U.S. 40 we drove into the center of Wheeling, which is well-preserved for the most part, to find two bridges, one famous one that used to be the worldâ€™s longest suspension bridge when it was first built and another one, much newer, which is less pleasing to the eye but does the job just the same. We drove to Wheeling Island in the Ohio River on the new bridge, parked, and walked back to Wheeling by way of the suspension bridge and back to the car over the new bridge, which surprisingly also had a pedestrian walkway. Itâ€™s quite an experience to walk across a bridge. In a car you donâ€™t notice the vibrations of the bridge caused by traffic moving along the deck, but you sure do on foot! And even though I know it would be far more dangerous if you felt no movement at all, it still *feels* scary!

McCarthy made his Lincoln Day speech in which he accused the State Department of harboring Communists. I knew he had spoken to the Republican Womenâ€™s Club, because I read somewhere that McCarthy said he would have chosen a  more prominent venue if heâ€™d known how important that speech would be to his political career. Unsurprisingly, the visitor center isnâ€™t too keen on highlighting the cityâ€™s role - however unwittingly - in a shameful chapter of recent American history, but the lady did point me to the Wheeling Public Library,  [20120514-121417] about two blocks away, where a very nice and helpful reference librarian pulled up an article that mentioned the venue. And since the library also has a collection of Wheeling Intelligencer newspapers on microfilm, I pulled the reel that had the paper in which McCarthyâ€™s speech was mentioned. [20120514-122513] As it turns out, the senator spoke at the McLure Hotel on Market Street. It still exists today. One mystery solved ;-) [20120514-144012] [20120514-144031]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After a leisurely lunch we drove on into Ohio, with Eric on a quest to find the S-bridges on the National Road in the Buckeye State. They used to build S-curves into the road to make it so the bridge would be exactly perpendicular to the river bank, so they would be cheaper and easier to make. Only one of the three bridges was still open to traffic, so we drove over it.

Either Ohio law doesnâ€™t require them to put reflectors on their buggies or they belong to a particularly conservative sect of Amish who believe that the government violates their First Amendment right to freedom of religion if it requires them to use reflectors (and never mind that they stop at a decidedly un-16th century gas station or have a plastic Rubbermaid jug and a nylon cooler on the back of the buggy). Iâ€™m happy to report that I did my bit for the First Amendment when I happened to notice a church advertising a local Tea Party meeting.

Since The Wilds also provides lodging, we thought it might be fun to spend the night there. Well, sure, but not to the tune of several hundred dollars! Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a great wildlife preserve, but it canâ€™t be *that* great. However, the country surrounding it is beautiful, too, so it wasnâ€™t a complete waste of gas. It must be very sparsely populated, since we hardly saw any cars and not too many houses, either. One high school we drove past was scarcely bigger than a large suburban house! Unfortunately, I donâ€™t remember what county it was in, so I canâ€™t look it up.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We drove back to the interstate to find more affordable lodging for the night and ended up at a Days Inn [20120514-184943] near exit 178 on I-70, where either the maid or the management or both believe that traveling is no reason to neglect oneâ€™s daily devotions.

When the coal ran out or became too costly to extract the government made American Electric Power reclaim the land that they had ruined. Yes, that would be the Environmental Protection Agency established by Republican president Nixon and so hated by Mr. Boehner and his cronies in congress today. While itâ€™s great to see the  ongoing reclamation effort, I doubt that AEP is doing it out of the kindness of its corporate heart. Itâ€™s just that thereâ€™s probably  not much else they can safely do with it, like sell it to a developer to build houses on. It would be a Love Canal waiting to happen. In one area, trees that were planted over 20 years ago have only grown a couple of feet because the quality of the soil is so poor. The park people actually have to build structures under which the animals can find shade. [20120515-125340] [20120515-125347]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Nevertheless, the park itself apparently does a lot of work in the propagation of endangered species and it even houses some species that have become extinct in the wild. For example, they work with researchers from China on a project to increase the number of Sichuan Taksin, a species of goat. Since these animals live in the province of Sichuan where it can be bitterly cold in the winter, they consider a sunny, mid-70 degree day much too hot and so it hides out in the shade at the water.

But the cheetah looked at us as if it thought: â€œYou people are *crazy,* walking around in this heat!â€ and the wild dogs trotted around in their enclosure as if to show off. The tour guide told us that these animals are so ferocious that even their keeper canâ€™t go into the enclosure or heâ€™d get ripped to shreds. They have to throw the meat over the fence. These animals will eat anything, which is why they have this sign on the fence: [20120515-115904]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The open air safari took about 2.5 hours, with two breaks of about 25 minutes each.

I&apos;m not much into airplanes, but since itâ€™s also the site where the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in the former Yugoslavia were signed, I thought it would be okay to go there, briefly look at the aircraft and then move on to the interesting part of the exhibit. Boy, was I ever wrong!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;First off, if you want to learn about the Dayton Peace Accords, youâ€™d better find some other location, like the National Archives in College Park, for example, because there is hardly a exposition panelâ€™s worth of information on the Third Balkan War (the first two having taken place in 1912 and 1913, respectively). Thereâ€™s a tiny section on it in the Cold War section of the museum - which is wrong in and of itself, since it couldnâ€™t have happened but for the enforced and accelerated thaw caused by the end of the Cold War, but nothing else.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Second, if you ever visit the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, you want to make sure you have *at least* a couple of hours to devote to it. We got up somewhat late, breakfasted leisurely (and copiously) at a local Waffle House and then drove to Wright-Pat, as the locals call it. I learned that from one of the staff members at The Wilds, who happened to be from Dayton. [20120516-093908]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As I said, I thought Iâ€™d just glance at some of the airplane exhibits and then have time to look at the really interesting stuff, but I quickly became completely engrossed in the history of aviation in general and military aviation in particular. For example, I had long been amazed at how World War II era planes seem to be made of material that resembles nothing so much as soda cans hammered together. On the walkway to the museum you pass by a monument to the pilots who flew â€œover the hump,â€ meaning, they flew planes carrying supplies to China, in an attempt to mollify Chiang Kai Chekâ€™s delusions of grandeur and keep him from signing a separate peace with Japan.  [20120516-102449] Yes, yes, I realize that the planes were not actually made that flimsy, but they sure donâ€™t look like theyâ€™re particularly well-made, certainly not anything I myself would care to hop over the Himalayas with! But looking at the models the museum had of the earliest planes, I realized that those â€œsoda canâ€ airplanes must have seemed quite an improvement over the â€œumbrella-typeâ€ aircraft aviation started out with. [20120516-103054] Of course, I had seen pictures of the first aircraft put together by the Wright Brothers, but thatâ€™s not the same as actually the thing itself. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At any rate, we spent more than an hour in the first half of three immense hangars and we realized that we would need to move faster if we were to have enough time to go through all three hangars and the displays outside and still have time to get to Columbus by 5 p.m. So we moved to the hall devoted to aviation during World War II, thinking that weâ€™d be done with that pretty quickly, since the basic story is of course pretty familiar. But you always learn something new. I never knew that Walt Disney had volunteered to design badges for the U.S. Army Air Force (it was not yet a separate branch of service) and I never thought I would see Donald Duck in a military incarnation, and pretty ferocious-looking at that. Of course, Disney being Disney, it quickly re-established its copyright after the war and as a result, you canâ€™t buy a Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse badge in the museum shop. Nor did I know that planes that carried wounded soldiers from battlefields were also used to bring in supplies, so that they couldnâ€™t use the Red Cross symbol. Nurses who accompanied wounded men on these flights volunteered for duty, because it was so hazardous. [20120516-121353]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the World War II exhibit we moved on to the exhibits on the Korean War and the War in Southeast Asia, as the museum calls the Vietnam War. I suppose itâ€™s one way of looking at it, just like the South likes to call the Civil War the War between the States. I disagree with their appellation, especially since they donâ€™t call the Korean War the War in Northeast Asia, even though the top commander in the field (well, not really in the field, since he hardly ever showed his face in Korea), [20120516-124707] Douglas MacArthur is known to have said that he prayed every night that the Chinese would enter the war. MacArthur was of the opinion that licking the Chinese Communists on the battlefield would be a matter of small moment, since he could count on the help of his buddy Chiang and his Nationalist Forces ensconced on Taiwan. Never mind that it was the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Army, i.e. Communists, who had forced him to retreat to Taiwan. One of the panels also referred to â€œstrategic bombing of North Korean industry,â€ which is nonsense. Korea had spent the better part of the 20th century up to that point as a Japanese colony, run with such brutality that it would make even the Belgian Congo seem like an earthly paradise. Korea, either North or South of the 38th parallel, did not have any industry to speak of.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Of course, it *is* the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force so one expects a certain level of whitewashing. But what is the use of having a museum in which to commemorate the history of one of the nationâ€™s branches of service if itâ€™s going to be mostly spin? To quote Cicero: â€œTo be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.â€ &lf;&nl;In the exhibit on the Vietnam War - excuse me, the Southeast Asian War - there is not one word about how the French got their derriÃ¨res kicked at Dien Bien Phu, whereupon the U.S. stepped in with extensive offers of military assistance so as to keep the French in line in Europe, where the U.S. wanted to rearm Germany. On a side note, I have always thought that if it hadnâ€™t been for the anti-communist trolls in Congress and the media, we should have felt great affinity for the North-Vietnamese under General VÃµ NguyÃªn GiÃ¡p.  He had his  troops disassembled heavy artillery, cart it up the mountains in pieces using manpower or bicycles for transport, reassembled them and used them to besiege Dien Bien Phu for two months until the French garrison surrendered. Now *thereâ€™s* resourcefulness for you! &lf;&nl;There is not a word about the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that underpinned U.S. military operations and which is by now well-known to be a tissue of falsehoods. [20120516-125740]&lf;&nl;It mentions the 1972 Easter Offensive - no doubt the North Vietnamese had an entirely different name for it - that led to an extensive bombing campaign, Operation Linebacker, against North Vietnamese targets, culminating in the Christmas Bombings of Hanoi, mostly aimed at the civilian population. &lf;&nl;The inglorious Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975 merits exactly one newspaper headline on display: â€œItâ€™s All Over.â€  &lf;&nl;I donâ€™t want to review the entire history of the Vietnam War, but I think Iâ€™ve made it clear that these are some very significant omissions. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Of course, the Air Force did great things, too. One example would be the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49, when the U.S. and Royal Air Force worked together to keep an entire city supplied with coal and food and even candy for the children of Berlin in operation â€œLittle Vittles.â€ This was a major propaganda coup for the West. [20120516-132534] I hadnâ€™t known that salt was in short supply in Berlin and that transporting salt is dangerous to aircraft because itâ€™s corrosive and abrasive. Youâ€™d think it wouldnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s packaged properly, but apparently salt had to be flown in by RAF planes that were normally used on maritime missions, since those were specially treated to withstand corrosion. One of the displays showed the bags of coal that were flown into Berlin daily. Commented one of the kids from a school group: â€œOh, look! Body bags!â€ Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important to tell the truth.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the Berlin Airlift we moved into the hangar devoted to the history of the Cold War. At the end of it is a tall missile silo that held a variety of Minute Men missiles. Since we recently had a discussion on Facebook about the use of the Space Shuttle for propaganda when the Air Force put it on display for the European NATO allies in the 1980 to counter the disease known as â€œhollanditis,â€ I particularly wanted to see a Cruise Missile if they had one on display. As it happens, itâ€™s nothing much to look at. [20120516-141328] This drab olive missile (the top one in the picture) is what all the fuss was about.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By now it was past 2 p.m. and if we were going to be back in Columbus by 5, we had to get moving. So we only spent a short time looking at the replicas of a World War II British control tower, which they built in Dayton using the original blueprints. [20120516-143745] I hope they had a better quality black-out curtains in England, though, because the ones they put up in Dayton were pretty much useless. There was also a Nissen hut furnished as a mission head quarters. [20120516-143508] It showed officers preparing for a bombing mission to Germany, for which they would have to fly over German-occupied Holland. [20120516-143430] It is because of the dedication of the young men (and women!) of what has been called â€œthe greatest generationâ€ that Eric and I could walk around in Dayton, OH, speaking Dutch or English as we please and not German. We owe them a debt of gratitude. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;And on that note we left Dayton to drive to Columbus to visit Mark and meet his dog Hoshi. [20120516-174357] Mark had meant to show off how obedient Hoshi was, but like a typical toddler, he was so excited about having company that he refused to obey. We took him and his roommate Kyle out to dinner and Hoshi went with us, too, and during dinner he was very well behaved. [20120516-180911] [20120516-181358] [20120516-184915] For dessert we went to Jeniâ€™s on High Street, a local ice cream shop that the Washington Post had featured about a year ago. It has some very off-beat flavors of ice cream. We meant to get ice cream there when we took Mark to Columbus, but we couldnâ€™t find the place. Itâ€™s a very small store front with an even smaller sign out front, but this time we knew where to look. I finally had my chocolate cayenne pepper ice cream (look for Queen City Cayenne) and it was great!

But since we had a whole day to cover the distance between Columbus and Toledo, we took our time. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Near Marion we saw a sign for a tourist information center, so we decided to stop there and see if there was anything interesting to see or do in the area. As it happens, Marion is the home town of President Warren G. Harding, but we didnâ€™t feel like spending time indoors because the weather was so nice. Besides, Harding is not  one of the great presidents, so a drive by his house, with the famous porch from which he conducted his election campaign, was enough for us.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Marion is also home to the Wyandot Popcorn Museum, the worldâ€™s largest collection of pop corn carts. Great, weâ€™ll take your word for it. Instead we drove a little ways outside the city to the Marion Tallgrass Trail, a 12-mile trail that follows the bed of the Erie-Lackawanna railroad. You can still see bits and pieces of the railroad along the trail. [20120517-135647] Sic transit gloria mundi. We didnâ€™t have time to hike the whole trail, since it was already past noon, but we went a couple of miles up the trail and saw birds and wildflowers and even a turtle basking on a log in the sun.

Doug is very much into cycling, both motorcycles and the human-powered kind and also kayaking, although that was a little hard to get pictures of  in a town that isnâ€™t anywhere close to a body of water. Why they named it for the great seafaring city of Genoa is anybodyâ€™s guess. Youâ€™d think there are towns inland from that city that they could have named the place for, no? But anyway, we had a great dinner at Rayz CafÃ© in Genoa and then drove onto the Yorksâ€™ farm using Dougâ€™s directions.

Kandace works in the PR &amp; Marketing department of the zoo and had been pretty busy with the arrangements for the opening day festivities and she had left to go to work by the time we got up at about 7 a.m. So that tells you something about how hectic her day was. Ken drove us to the zoo a little after 9 and we got there just in time for the official opening, which was great. After the obligatory speeches by some officials and politicians, members of an African dance troupe danced their way around the little plaza out front and then led the crowd into the newly opened exhibit.

Itâ€™s a small zoo, but they really do a lot of work to keep things looking up to date and fresh. I particularly like the way theyâ€™ve re-purposed some of the historic buildings. The old science building is now used as office space and Kandaceâ€™s office is in there. Kandace said that Toledo, Ohio and Toledo, Spain were two of the earliest cities in the world to form a sister city relationship, in token of which Spanish Toledo sent American Toledo tiled murals. The back wall of Kandaceâ€™s office is a scene from Don Quixote Another building thatâ€™s found a new lease on life is the one that used to house the big cats.

[20120519-101313]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But first we visited the Toledo Museum of Art and especially the Glass Pavilion. Toledo used to be a big glass manufacturing center and the founder of the glass industry in Toledo, Edward Drummond Libbey, left the museum $1M in his will. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons it has an extensive collection of art from the ancient world (pre-pharaonic Egypt through late Roman Empire) and Renaissance art. There is art from other eras too, of course, but those are the parts we saw today. Check out the statue of the cat goddess Bastet, the Alexander the Great tetradachms, the Seleucid drinking horn and  the Roman mosaic from the Carthage area.

[20120519-114351]  [20120519-114544]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I particularly wanted to see the Glass Pavilion because we had missed that on our 2007 trip. We were in Toledo on a Monday, the one day that everything but the zoo and the botanical garden is closed. But we made it up this time. The Glass Pavilion itself is made of glass as much as possible and itâ€™s only been open since 2006. The first thing you see when you come in is a huge Chihuly chandelier. Then there are several rooms with glass artefacts, from ancient to modern. I only wished I could have some of it wrapped up to take home with me!

Itâ€™s great to have an Ohio native for a guide, because Ken told us that if we wanted to follow the Ohio Coastal Trail, for which weâ€™d seen sign outside the museum, all we had to do was get on the Ohio 163 and follow that. He was absolutely spot on, and we followed it as far east as Lorain, a depressed looking town on the outskirts of Cleveland. It was such a depressing area that we decided to get off the 163 and onto the interstate. But most of Coastal Trail was well-worth seeing, even if it was a slower drive.

Before her death I had made it a habit to write her a letter every other week. She once said she really enjoyed my letters and read them over and over again because they were so chatty and cheerful. After she passed away, Eric and I went through her things and found several shoe boxes full of the letters I&apos;d written since we moved to the U.S. which she had saved.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The thing with habits, though, is that they&apos;re often easy to get into, but hard to shake. Though she&apos;s been gone for three-quarters of a year, I still find myself thinking: \"I&apos;ve got to remember to write Ma (which is what I called her) about this!\" only to realize that I won&apos;t ever be able to write to her again. It happened again this past weekend, perhaps because Major-general Braddock had a connection to Bergen op Zoom, Ma&apos;s hometown. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, below is the letter I would have written to her about our Pennsylvania exploits had she lived.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Dearest Ma,&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When they say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a small world, people generally refer to the present, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m finding that it also goes for history. Who would have thought, when we moved to America, that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d come across a guy who played an active role in both the history of both Bergen op Zoom and the United States? &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Major-general Edward Braddock (1695-1755) was a soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son and had seen action previously at the third siege of Bergen op Zoom in 1747 in the closing days of the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1755 he was sent to the colonies to help drive the French out of Ohio territory. To get to the site of the battle, his men had to widen a trail previously made by George Washington so it could accommodate their artillery pieces and supply wagons. Unfortunately for him, logistics didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t carry the day and he was mortally wounded at the Battle of the Monongahela in western Pennsylvania. He died at Fort Necessity, the base camp established by Washington, on July 13, 1755. To make sure the French and/or their Native American allies would not find BraddockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grave and desecrate it, Washington had buried in the middle of the road BraddockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troops had cleared and then made them march over it so it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be found. [20120714-100055]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Parts of Braddock Road still exist today. It later became part of the National Road and later still part of the U.S. highway system. In fact, Braddock&apos;s remains were found during construction of the National Road, but the memorial that is there now wasn&apos;t built until 1913. Eric has been looking into the history of the National Road and how it relates to I-70, the length of which we will travel in September. We simply arrived at Braddock Road by taking I-70 west, to I-68 in western Maryland and then U.S. 40 into western Pennsylvania, which took us a little over three hours on a Friday night. Traveling through the area gives you a great deal of respect for the effort of Braddock, Washington and their men, who basically had to build the road they traveled on as they went along over steep, densely wooded mountains. If you look at other military engagements, you marvel at the distances armies covered over equally unforgiving terrain during the Civil War, too. And when we were out west in 2007, we drove along a road that Mormons traveled as they settled in Utah. We had a comfortable minivan with A/C and all kinds of creature comforts that zipped along a smooth asphalt surface, while they traveled in ox-drawn wagons through a wilderness that included a 1,000 feet drop! [20120714-094358] [20120714-112055]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we walked part of the Braddock Road, in part as a segment of our I-70 tour and to honor its somewhat tenuous connection to Bergen op Zoom. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sad to think that battles are often fought in the most beautiful fields. We saw that at Antietam earlier this year and in Flanders two years ago as well. Eric tells me that the battlefields of Normandy, many of which are now war cemeteries, are also very beautiful. No doubt battlefields going back to the ancient Greeks and Romans and other ancient civilizations are also beautiful. Why fight for a tract of land if it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t desirable, right? So in addition to the historic significance, we made a point of enjoying the natural beauty of the place as well.

One of those pacific interludes gave rise to the construction of the National Road and with it the building of taverns and inns along the way so stage coach drivers could exchange horses and passengers could get something to eat and, if necessary, a bed to sleep in. Apparently, stage coach passengers were not too picky about hygiene. They usually slept fully clothed (though the rules of the inn forced them to take off their boots), sometimes as many as five to a bed. And we thought it something of an indignity to have to share a bathroom with another couple at the Stonehouse Inn Bed &amp; Breakfast because we had booked late and all they had available was a room on the top floor that shares a bathroom with a neighboring room!

It was intended as a summer retreat for the Kaufman family of Pittsburgh who owned a number of department stores. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beautiful house that really works with its natural surroundings, as the architect intended, but not a very practical dwelling. [20120714-144814] [20120714-145159] [20120714-145809]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There is probably a reason most houses are built on the principle of a center hallway with other rooms branching off of it. This house is all about interconnectedness and enjoying the great outdoors, but the result is that it is something of warren of rooms and the people who owned the house having to do battle with the architect as to whether or not they could have a swimming pool or a garage. The architect finally Ã¢â‚¬Å“allowedÃ¢â‚¬Â construction of a swimming pool as part of the guest house, which was built a few years after the main house. Wright considered that garages invite clutter and so he would only build car ports. Not that he is wrong about the clutter, though. It is very typically American to see one or more $30,000 vehicles parked on the driveway in front of the garage, which is crammed to the rafters with more or less worthless junk. Eric was particularly indignant about the architect deciding what the homeowners could or could not have. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I want to have a swimming pool or a garage, who is he to say I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have it? And if I want to put my garage full of junk, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my business, not his!Ã¢â‚¬Â I suppose I should be glad we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the money to have a custom-designed house! [20120714-170847]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The trouble with these historically and/or architecturally significant houses is that as soon as they stop being private residences and fall into the hands of some trust or non-profit or other, those organizations become invested in the houseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s importance to the point of myopia. The trust that runs Fallingwater is so enamored of its self-appointed role as guardian of the Frank Lloyd Wright legacy that they forget that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willingness to come pay homage that makes it possible to maintain it almost as a shrine. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a shrine that stank of urine absolutely everywhere. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if they had had some sort of sewer problem or if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because it had just rained after a somewhat prolonged dry spell which brought out the smell, but it was horrible. Eric said he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t notice it, so perhaps it speaks more to my personal hygiene than the houseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mechanical system. However,  in my defense I will tell you that I only smelled it at Fallingwater and nowhere else. But when you think about a house that cost 31 times what it would have cost to build an average home in 1936 and since emperor Vespasian (69-79 CE) said pecunia non olet, it should not stink to high heaven. Vespasian is credited with building public urinals, and using the liquid collected there for use in tanning and other chemical processes. Whoever wanted to buy the chemicals derived from said liquid paid a tax that paid for the construction and upkeep of the urinals. To this day, public urinals are known as vespasiani in Italy. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;For one thing, touring Fallingwater is pretty expensive, even if you go to the trouble of booking tour tickets online. For another, they make you stand or sit in line and bark at you to join your tour group. We were the last tour group of the day, no. 65, so I can imagine they get a little tired of it, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not my fault they try to cram that many tours into a single day. You are allowed to reverently view the house and the artifacts it contains, but heaven forbid anyone should  snap a picture of an interior, because you might sell it to National Geographic or something. Yeah, right. Of course, I understand that continuous exposure to flash photography would cause materials to deteriorate, but they act like absolute nazis about it. You are allowed to take pictures of the exterior, but only if you swear on the bible that you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use it for commercial purposes. Well, duh. Like those crappy cameras in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iPhones are going to produce commercial quality pictures. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Fallingwater we toured around the western Pennsylvania countryside, until we ended up in West Virginia more by accident than design. Since we hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really made plans or prepared ourselves in any way to visit other places, we decided weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do better to head for home after dinner. So we dined at some golf club in West Virginia that couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t decide if it wanted to an upscale place or a family-style restaurant and consequently didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do a good job at either, and drove home afterwards. Unfortunately, we got caught in a severe thunderstorm just on the West Virginia-Maryland line. At intervals it rained so hard that we slowed down to 40-45 mph even on I-68. Luckily the weather got better after Hancock, and we made it home safely, arriving in Ellicott City just after midnight. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So that was our Pennsylvania adventure this weekend.

Maybe I can make todayâ€™s entry interesting without pictures. We were up at 3 a.m. and in the car by 4.15 and we were past Cumberland by the time the sun was up, even though we ran into a couple of patches of really dense fog at higher elevations. We made very good time, even if we cheated a little by not taking I-70 all the way through Pennsylvania. Weâ€™d driven it before, and itâ€™s not the most enjoyable stretch of road, to say the least. Instead we opted to follow I-68, which ends at I-79 in West-Virginia and then turns north into Pennsylvania. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Along I-79 I saw a sign for a minersâ€™ memorial at a rest stop. Thatâ€™s something you donâ€™t see every day, so we stopped to take a closer look at it. As it turns out, there used to be a coal mine right underneath where the Kirby, PA, welcome center is located now. On December 9, 1962, a methane gas explosion 460 feet below ground killed 37 miners. Their names are listed on the memorial. Inside the welcome center there is a large mural depicting miners at work and a display case of various pieces of mine workersâ€™ equipment, some donated by the families of the dead miners, as well as chunks of the three different types of coal found in the region. Much of western Maryland, West-Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania and is coal mining country and they arenâ€™t strangers to mining accidents. In 1928 an accident killed 195 miners in the same area and just over two years ago an accident in a West-Virginia mine claimed the lives of 21 miners. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Mining is a way to make a living, of course, but it irks me when you drive along I-70 in PA and you come upon a billboard saying that the fact that there are no jobs in the region is all President Obamaâ€™s fault, when five miles down the road thereâ€™s a fracking outfitâ€™s billboard saying that theyâ€™re hiring! Call me a cynic or a communist or both if you like, but I have zero trust for mining outfits who claim that their operations are so safe that nothing can possibly go wrong and yada yada yada. If itâ€™s so safe, how come you donâ€™t disclose what kind of chemicals you use to hydraulically fracture (thatâ€™s where the word â€œfrackingâ€ comes from) the shale to get out the gas? If the water in fracked areas is so safe, how come some people can light it on fire straight out of the faucet? And how come an oil pipeline feels it has to play hardball when residents in an area where they want to run a pipeline ask reasonable questions about the safety of said pipe? &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But enough already. We were on the road to Columbus, to have lunch with Mark and to see his new apartment. It was raining in Columbus and Mark asked us to pick him up at the animal sciences building, which we did. Fortunately he didnâ€™t have his dog Hoshi with him, because there wouldnâ€™t have been enough room in the car. You wouldnâ€™t believe the amount of stuff we take with us now that itâ€™s just the two of us! Eric proposed that we have lunch at White Castle in honor of Terry, who has a serious White Castle craving that she canâ€™t satisfy very often because we donâ€™t have them in Maryland. Perhaps the White Castle place on High Street wasnâ€™t the best one, but none of us were particularly impressed with it. Mark and I shared a combo meal of cheeseburger sliders that supposedly came with jalapenos, but we never found any and when we complained the lady pointed out that the jalapenos were supposed to be in the cheese. The cheese did have a faintly peppery taste, but nothing like real jalapenos. They put on way too much onion, too, in our opinion. Anyway, weâ€™ve crossed that off our bucket list. Sorry, Terry :-)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After weâ€™d admired Markâ€™s new place - itâ€™s much the same as his old apartment, but in a much better neighborhood - we continued on our way to Indiana. We ran into a couple of rain storms along I-70, courtesy of Hurricane Isaac, I guess. Near Dayton we noticed that the pylons of the overpasses all features airplane silhouettes in silver, which looked really pretty. Weâ€™d completely missed that when we were there in May. Just goes to show that visiting a place just once is never enough. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Just after the Indiana line we spotted a National Road Welcome Center. We wanted to stop in Richmond, IN, anyway because itâ€™s home to one of the Madonnas of the Trail, so we decided to see what else was going on there. As it happens, Richmond churches feature quite a collection of Tiffany windows. I suppose it got started when a wealthy local family commissioned a Tiffany window for the library in 1895. Some of the churches apparently felt they must not fall behind, so they ordered Tiffany windows for their sanctuaries as well. They have an absolutely ridiculous number of churches in Richmond. There are five different ones in a six block stretch of North A street alone, and we saw plenty more on our way into town, which consists of 36,812 people according to the 2010 census. The Reid Memorial Presbyterian Church has no fewer than 62 Tiffany windows. Unfortunately, we did not get to admire them, because it was closed. We did see the Tiffany window at the First Presbyterian Church, but not those at St. Paulâ€™s Episcopal, because itâ€™s only open until 1 p.m. and we didnâ€™t get there until 5. But since we were out of the car anyway and we felt like taking a walk, we walk four blocks to the Morrison-Reeves Library to admire their fine Tiffany windows. One large one features Johannes Gutenburg checking the type on his printing press and two smaller ones that feature the names of famous printer, such as Aldous Manutious, a famous 15th century printing house in Venice, and William Caxton in 15th century London. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;An information panel near the windows told us that the original Morrison-Reeves Library had been torn down in 1975, but that pieces of its interior had been saved and put to use in the new building. As we were ready to leave, I noticed a particularly fine clock hanging near the customer service desk and I asked if that had also come from the original library. The librarian didnâ€™t know, but she introduced us to  the libraryâ€™s resident historian, Ms. Sue King. She took us on a quick tour of the library, which was very kind of her, considering that we barged in on her out of the blue, and she gave us a lot of information about the history of Richmond. For example, on April 6, 1968 an accident with a gas leak at a local sporting goods store that produced its own gun cartridges caused an enormous explosion that killed 41 people and  flattened several blocks of downtown Richmond and blew out windows for miles around. Only the fact that the libraryâ€™s Tiffany windows happened to sit in a north-facing bay, while the explosion was to the south, prevented them from being destroyed in the blast. They say itâ€™s an ill wind that blows no good, so the city council of Richmond decided to use the fact that much of downtown had been flattened anyway to get serious about urban renewal. They ended up making Main Street into a promenade and pedestrian mall, but unfortunately, many of the merchants thought that the facades of their late Victorian buildings badly needed updating. In many cases, they completely ruined the historic buildings. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By now it was 5.30 p.m. and Eric still had to get his pictures of the Madonna of the Trail, which we had passed on the way into town. Itâ€™s right on the edge of Glenn Miller Park, though I canâ€™t for the life of me figure out why they should name a Richmond, IN, park after the legendary band leader. When Eric had gotten his Madonna fix (he has to get it somewhere, right, and Iâ€™m an unlikely candidate), we found a motel near the intersection of US 40 and I-70 and after a shower and a meal consisting rice crackers with cheese, mini cinnamon-raisin bagels, a sliced cucumber from my garden and the last of the oatmeal cookies, we plonked ourselves down on the king-sized bed to write up todayâ€™s diary entry - with or without pictures - and then weâ€™re going to call it a day.','2012-09-05 00:36:34','B','2012-09-05 00:28:56','N'),('20120905D0001','nicoline','20120905','Update','During breakfast I looked through yesterday&apos;s pictures and I decided it would be a shame not to post any of them.

Since we werenâ€™t in any great hurry, we decided to take U.S. 40 and see if anything interesting turned up. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The first thing we saw just outside Richmond was a huge Mourdock for Senate sign. Mourdock is the TP candidate who defeated long-time Indiana Senator Dick Lugar in the primaries earlier this year. You donâ€™t see a lot of political signs here, but the ones you do see definitely arenâ€™t for any Democrats. At one point at U.S. 40 we were parked next to a car that had been behind us for a couple of miles, with an excellent view of our Obama and other â€œleftyâ€ bumper stickers. I was driving and a just happened to look over at the passenger in the car next to me. The elderly lady looked as if she greatly feared that I was about to eat her or something. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One of the first places we came to was Cambridge Town. According a historical marker, the town was first laid out in 1836 and quickly grew because it was a hub for no fewer than four railroad lines and it also boasted a canal. In fact, Cambridge Town is going to be celebrating â€œcanal daysâ€ next weekend, but donâ€™t ask me how. Thereâ€™s nothing left of the canal that we could find, even though we followed the signs to a scenic drive that supposedly ran alongside the canal. Oh, well. It was a nice looking town anyway. Incredibly spacious, too, as all towns tend to be here. They donâ€™t go in for narrow winding streets in these parts. [20120905-094552] [20120905-094606] [20120905-094953] [20120905-095008]  [20120905-095357] [20120905-095453]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On the way to Indianapolis we passed through the town of Dublin, which at one time was a hotbed for the campaign for womenâ€™s rights, just four years after the Seneca Falls Convention.

[20120905-102316]  [20120905-102429]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Just around 12 noon we made it into the center of Indianapolis, looking for the Indiana Soldiersâ€™ and Sailorsâ€™ Monument that was built in 1901. I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect, but itâ€™s quite an experience to come upon it suddenly and see it rise 284 1/2 feet in the air! You donâ€™t see it as you drive in because thereâ€™s lots of tall buildings around it. I managed to find a parking space right on Monument Circle and brilliantly parallel parked the car behind some kind of electric vehicle and a couple of cars in front of a Texas car with Obama stickers! The monument is open to the public and you can choose to pay a small fee to take the elevator to the top, or you can walk up 331 steps for free. Since we spend the majority of our day sitting on our behinds in the car, we walked up. Letâ€™s just say that we could use the exercise. The view over Indianapolis is worth it! Thereâ€™s a Civil War museum in the base of the monument, but itâ€™s only open Friday through Sunday, so we didnâ€™t get to visit it. [20120905-115113]  [20120905-115158]  [20120905-115328]  [20120905-120129]  [20120905-120205]  [20120905-120234]  [20120905-120249]  [20120905-120309]  [20120905-120343]  [20120905-120504]  [20120905-120632]  [20120905-115045]  [20120905-114848]  &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From atop the monument we saw that there was some kind of market in progress, so when we had walked downstairs we went towards it. But as the sky was darkening rather alarmingly and the wind was clearly picking up, most merchants were packing up their stuff and besides, it was a farmersâ€™ market and we werenâ€™t in need of any produce. Weâ€™re still working on eating the cucumbers and apples we brought with us. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So we went back to the car and drove out in search of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Not that weâ€™ve all of a sudden developed a passion for the Indy 500, but weâ€™ve been listening to Earl Swiftâ€™s book â€œThe Big Roads: The Untold Story of the Engineers, Visionaries, and Trailblazers Who Created the American Superhighways.â€  In the first few chapters, Swift tells the story of an Indianapolis entrepeneur Carl G. Fisher, who became the driving force behind the creation of the Lincoln Highway, but who actually got his start in business selling bicycles. When you think about it, itâ€™s not that strange, since you need good roads just as much to ride a bike as to drive a car. He and three business partners built the Speedway in 1909, as an area where cars could be tested on a proper road. Many roads, even in the city, were not yet paved at that time and the least little rain turned them into bogs. Later on they added various racing events. Fisher went on to develop Miami Beach, but was almost wiped out when a hurricane hit the area in September 1926, while he was simultaneous working on developing the Montauk area of Long Island, NY. He sold his interest in the speedway to Eddie Rickenbacher, a World War I flying ace, but he didnâ€™t manage to raise enough money and the 1929 stock market crash pretty much wiped him out financially. He ended up living in a tiny cottage at the Caribbean Club in Key Largo, his last development project, according to Wikipedia: â€œ... about 8 years after his death, the Caribbean Club became famous as the filming site for the 1947 film  â€œKey Largoâ€ starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Almost 60 years later, in 2007, filled with Bogart memorabilia, it is still in business as a tourist attraction.â€ Fisher died of a stomach hemorrhage in 1939. [20120905-130056]  [20120905-141024]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We decided to visit the museum since we were in Indianapolis anyway, to see what it would say about Fisher, but in that respect itâ€™s rather disappointing. Of course, the museum is there for racing enthusiasts and they can certainly get their fix. There are lots of historic race cars, from 1911 to 2011, right next to one another, and the Stoddard-Packard pace car that Fisher himself drove in 1911. Some pretty big name drivers raced at Indianapolis, such as Formula One drivers Mario Andretti and Nelson Piquet. I know Iâ€™m hopelessly dating myself here, because these guys havenâ€™t been behind the wheel of an F1 car in 30 years or more, but I remember the sound of Formula One racing at the circuit at Zandvoort, the Netherlands. We spent many summers in the neighboring town of Bloemendaal and if the wind was just right, you could hear the race from where we were, a couple of miles north of the circuit. We never went to the circuit itself, which would probably have been way too expensive with five people.

We had intended to drive south on the Indianapolis beltway and take the I-69 down to Bloomington, but we missed the exit and ended up driving down Indiana State Routes 135 and 144. The latter was especially scenic, even if we did hit a detour due to a downed tree. But we found our way back to Bloomington easily enough and found a Dayâ€™s Inn quite close to downtown. We had a burger &amp; fries for dinner at Dennyâ€™s and weâ€™ll treat ourselves to a desert of M&amp;Ms. [20120905-153149]  [20120905-153816]  [20120905-160011]&lf;&nl;','2012-09-05 23:05:13','D','2012-09-05 23:05:13','N'),('20120906B0001','nicoline','20120906','Murals, bridges and crosses','Today was a day for murals. We had set apart this day to see the Thomas Hart Benton murals at Indiana University. Iâ€™d been on the phone with a lady from the art department a couple of times and weâ€™d agreed that we would be there on September 6 at 10.00 a.m. So we made our way to the IU campus in Bloomington and were amazed at the size of it. It takes up about a quarter of the town and the art department lady said that Bloomingtonâ€™s population more than doubles when the students come back to school in the fall. Itâ€™s huge. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Of course, we got to campus way before 10, so we killed some time exploring. What little we saw of it is also very beautiful, with a large park-like area with walkways and brooks and little bridges between the buildings. These are some very lucky students! We also stumbled upon a manuscript collection in the Lilly Library that focused on the War of 1812, with pamphlets and books and prints related to that era. The library also owns a Gutenberg Bible, which surprised me, and a first edition of John James Audubonâ€™s â€œBirds of America,â€ which has so many different color plates that with the librarian changing the page once a week it takes eight and a half years to see all of them! Another thing I learned was that World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle was a native of Indiana who attended the Indiana University Bloomington. There is a memorial to him outside the Memorial Union and the building of the journalism school is named for him. [20120906-092514]  [20120906-092524]   [20120906-094721]   [20120906-092550]   [20120906-095045]  [20120906-095347]  [20120906-085505]  [20120906-085547]  &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When the time finally came to see the murals, we stepped into the theater that houses them and spent a good 45 minutes looking at them in detail. Unfortunately, the most controversial part of the mural, the one that depicts the klansmen, is housed in a different building. Itâ€™s inside an auditorium that is used as a classroom and therefore not readily available. That was kind of a bummer, because the klan-panel was what sparked my interest in the first place. Oh well. We did luck into an exposition of socialist-realist art by Rockwell Kent in the art museum next door. Kentâ€™s work often appeared in leftist publications. He even won the Lenin Peace Prize in 1967 as an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Fine Arts, even though his style of work was by that time rather old-fashioned.[20120906-101701]  [20120906-100341]  [20120906-101440]  [20120906-100453]  [20120906-100525]  [20120906-100543]  [20120906-100643]  [20120906-100713]  [20120906-100730]  [20120906-100858]  [20120906-100909]  [20120906-101048]  [20120906-101101]   [20120906-102210]  [20120906-102218] [20120906-102241]  [20120906-102311]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It, did however, fit in well with our second object the day, which was a visit to the Eugene V. Debs house in Terre Haute. Debs was a union organizer and one of the founders of the American Socialist Party. He ran for president on its ticket. He conducted his last campaign from his prison cell in Atlanta, where he had been sent after his conviction for sedition for publicly speaking out against Americaâ€™s entry into World War I. He even used campaign buttons that said â€œvote for prisoner #....â€ with a picture of Debs in his prison uniform. Debs also published a newspaper â€œAppeal to Reasonâ€ and wrote a large number of pamphlets. [20120906-125642]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Debs house itself is mainly interesting for the period furnishings and the political memorabilia. For many years it was used as a frat house, though every trace of the abuse it likely suffered in those days has been wiped out. But the most amazing part of the house comes as you walk up the stairs to the attic. There is still ugly 1970s paneling on the walls of the stairwell, but the attic is now in use as an auditorium and an art professor from Indiana State University in Terre Haute painted most of the roof with beautiful murals depicting Debsâ€™ life and work. Itâ€™s quite an experience to come upon it unawares!

Heâ€™d found out that Indiana has a fairly large number of covered bridges and there are several car tours you can take to see most of them. A lot are in the area near Terre Haute, so after we finished touring the Debs house, I drove around rural Indiana with Eric directing me where to turn and where to stop and he got out and took pictures of the covered bridges. I think we saw about a third of them. They all have warning signs saying that the area may be subject to flooding, but thereâ€™s hardly any danger of that at the moment. We saw some of the saddest-looking cornfields weâ€™ve ever come across, a testament to the drought in the Midwest. This being rural Indiana, we again saw Mourdock signs galore. Once near the end of the covered bridge tour, I thought I saw an Obama sign, but it was only a sign that encouraged people to sign up to help defeat the President. And if the political signs arenâ€™t enough of a reminder that we were in a blood-red state, thereâ€™s also church after church, mostly Church of the Nazarene and Assemblies of God, and crosses and billboards exhorting the public to make sure they arenâ€™t going to hell before itâ€™s too late.

It took some doing getting there, because the exit we needed was closed due to road maintenance, but we did at last manage to make our way there. Nobody else was there, which is a hopeful sign in my book. The cross is surrounded by panels depicting the Ten Commandments. Eric wanted me to stand near the thing to get a sense of scale, but I didnâ€™t. Why would I want to have my picture taken with a preposterously magnified instrument of torture? No thanks.

It&apos;s nice, but there is no feeling of authenticity.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The \"ghosts of the library\" presentation was technically amazing, [20120907-120027] leaving you wonder at the end what was real and what was movie. Beyond that, the life-size figures of Lincoln and his family in front of the White House replica in the central rotunda of the museum was nice, and the reconstructed log cabin was quite neat. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Lincoln museum we went to a Honda dealership, because a warning light had come on on the dashboard. The service manager was very kind and instead of making us wait for a mechanic to be available, he plugged in the diagnostic computer to find out what the problem was. It turned out that an oxygen sensor had gone bad, something that needs to be fixed before I have my next emission test but not something that impacts the car. So now we can continue without having to worry about that light. Kudos for Honda in Springfield, IL!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Springfield, we started following the old Route 66 for a while, starting out with lunch at the Cozy Dog Drive In. [20120907-132325] It&apos;s more a sit-down and drive-through place now, but they still serve their \"Cozy Dog\" (corn dog).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120907-132850] [20120907-132737] [20120907-132242] [20120907-132208] [20120907-134045] [20120907-133959]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Continuing on Route 66 we came through a mile-and-a-half long stretch in Auburn [20120907-140810] that has been re-created with brick on a concrete bed, the way some parts of the road were in the beginning. At this stretch you could really imagine driving the road in the 1940s and 1950s (although to be honest, by that time the brick would probably no longer have been there).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In Girard we entered a [20120907-143703] soda fountain shop that also had a lot of old memorabilia.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120907-143813] [20120907-143911] [20120907-144133]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Girard we drove quite a way down to Colinsville, where there was a [20120907-162918] water tower in the shape of a ketchup bottle next to the road. We then continued further south, towards Kaskaskia, the first capital of Illinois. We made it as far as Chester (birthplace of the creator of Popeye), where we crossed the Mississippi river, but by that time it was getting late and the weather had turned so bad (pitch dark clouds, driving rain, and so on) that we decided to find a hotel room instead. We had dinner at a Chines buffet (not bad, actually) and when we turned on our computers we learned that the storm we were taken refuge from actually had made the news.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120907-184223] [20120907-184323] [20120907-184429]&lf;&nl;','2012-09-08 02:47:02','D','2012-09-08 02:47:02','N'),('20120907D0002','nicoline','20120907','Three capitals','We managed to visit all three of Illinoisâ€™ state capitals - having woken up in the second one, Vandalia - which is pretty impressive, considering that our faithful Honda developed engine trouble which necessitated a trip to a Honda dealership in the stateâ€™s current capital. The lady at the Springfield visitor center sure thought it odd that we asked for the address of a car dealership rather than directions to any of the myriad Lincoln-related sights. But the Lincoln sites are pretty hard to miss in Springfield, while a Honda dealership is kind of hard to find. [20120907-091027] [20120907-095352]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We thought that driving into town on U.S. 51 and state route 29 weâ€™d be almost sure to come across one, but no such luck. So we decided to do the touristy thing first and stop at garage-museum on Route 66. It was kind of fun, lots of early 20th century automobile memorabilia, but more of a jumble of stuff than anything youâ€™d call a museum. We arrived at the same time as a group of Swedish tourists, corvette enthusiasts to judge by their t-shirts, who had flown into Chicago the day before and were going to drive the length of Route 66, all the way to Los Angeles. They had a bunch of questions about the road and wanted to look at *everything* so we slipped out to work on reaching our second goal. [20120907-103128] [20120907-103210] [20120907-103224]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One does not, after all, visit Illinois without paying homage to Abraham Lincoln. The Lincoln library is of course a research library that isnâ€™t really open to the public unless you come as a researcher. Some creative soul may be able to come up with some new angle of writing about Lincoln, but it must be getting more and more difficult. [20120907-110203] [20120907-122641]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In order to deal with all the ignoramuses who come to find out about Lincoln unencumbered by any kind of knowledge, they recently built a new Lincoln Museum right next to the library. It is a state of the art facility, where one is directed first to a holographic presentation sponsored by AT&amp;T, which is, I have to say, very well done. Of course, it helps to have gobs of money to spend on it as the telecom giant no doubt does. When the presentation opens it looks likes an actor (it canâ€™t be a librarian or an archivist, because the performance is so polished) explains a lot of things about the collection and what it can tell us today and things like that. When he opens a book, for example, a hologram appears to flutter out of its pages to â€œbring the past to lifeâ€ as it were. Itâ€™s until the end that you notice that the guy whoâ€™s doing the presentation is actually a hologram himself who turns out to be a Union soldier who was killed at some battle with some regiment of which only the flag they carried into battle was returned. Pretty nifty. [20120907-115137] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then you are directed to the next presentation, in Union Theater, the main sponsor of which is the Exelon Corporation. Itâ€™s all about an artist who supposedly gets the assignment to draw a picture or sculpt a bust of Abraham Lincoln. â€œI started out by finding out as much as I could about my subject.â€ Well, good luck with that. Iâ€™m not sure how many miles of library shelves are needed to house every book ever written about Lincoln, not to mention the thousands of artifacts stored in the Lincoln presidential library and no doubt elsewhere, too, but Iâ€™m pretty sure it would take you more than a lifetime to work your way through them. The presentation is, of course, state of the art, with all the appropriate sound effects timed for maximum effect - I jumped when John Wilkes Booth fired his shot at the president and the little girl sitting in front of me was scared witless by the Civil War sound effects. But the whole thing is just a little too slick, and a tad too nifty for its own good. [20120907-120027]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Of course itâ€™s hard to see how much one can still say about a man who has become a myth to the extent that Lincoln has. The museum does try. When, after the show, you go on a tour of the Lincoln White House, they show you just how unpopular the president was in his day. But again, itâ€™s too nifty. While you try to decipher the derogatory cartoons as they appeared in the popular press at the time, you are made to listen to a chorus of actorsâ€™ voices saying things that people will no doubt have said about Lincoln at the time, but it prevents you from concentrating. [20120907-115314]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The tableaux are beautifully done, but they inspired the most insipid commentary from a bunch of women accompanying children of various ages, whom I meanly supposed to be home-schooled. The girlsâ€™ questions seemed to focus mostly on the dresses as worn by Mrs. Lincoln and the boys were made to listen to a whole expose about â€œhow they did not have electricityâ€ and just think how terrible that would be: no air-conditioning. I know itâ€™s a heresy, but there really ought to be a way to make sure that homeschooling is actually a process in which knowledge is transferred, rather than a way of preventing your child from becoming contaminated with such worldly knowledge as - GASP! - evolution. But I digress. The museum annex to the Lincoln Presidential Library is just a 21st century way to keep the myth going and does nothing at all to inspire critical thinking or even the thought â€œbut what if...â€ And I guess corporate America prefers it that way. A presidential myth, nice and uncontroversial at (almost) the sesquicentennial of his death, without anyone asking awkward questions. [20120907-122431]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Since today was a Friday, we thought it best to get the engine trouble checked out before it we got stranded, who knows how many miles from anywhere out in the boonies. Of course the Honda place was on the other side of town, so we drove all the way around Springfield to get there. But itâ€™s all in the game and it turned out that it wasnâ€™t anything serious, just a bad oxygen sensor, which can wait until we get back to Maryland. After that, it was lunch time so we drove another big loop around and through Springfield to get to the Cozy Dog Drive Thru, a Route 66 landmark. As it turns out, cozy dogs are nothing but corn dogs, but it was fun to eat there anyway. After that, we continued on our way along Route 66, because there is a section of the road that is still paved with the original bricks. Letâ€™s just say thereâ€™s a reason they switched to blacktop... In Girard we paid a visit to a real soda fountain, where they have a large world map up on the wall with pins representing the states and countries that various visitors over the years have represented. Unfortunately, they already had a pin for Maryland. Iâ€™ve decided that when someone asks me where Iâ€™m from I just tell them Maryland and if they figure I canâ€™t possibly be a native, thatâ€™s just too bad. I can say â€œyâ€™allâ€ like the best of them and I figure that after 15 years in Maryland, Iâ€™ve earned the right to say Iâ€™m from that state, darn it! The last part of our Route 66 fix was to find and take a picture of a water tower thatâ€™s shaped like a ketchup bottle (not the real one, because that would have to be in Pittsburgh). [20120907-132242] [20120907-132737] [20120907-132850] [20120907-140815] [20120907-143640] [20120907-143813] [20120907-144004] [20120907-144133] [20120907-162918] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So much for Route 66. On our way out of Colinsville, home of the ketchup bottle water tower, we already caught a glimpse of the St. Louis arch across the river in Missouri, but we wanted to stick to Illinois a little while longer, because we wanted to visit its first capital, Kaskaskia. This modern-day metropolis of 14 souls actually has a storied past, having been started as a frontier fort during the reign of Louis XIV. We visited the ruins of Fort Kaskaskia, on a bluff above the Mississippi. You can see that that would have been a pretty strategic spot back in the day. After the French and Indian War France ceded the Illinois Territory to Britain and the town of Kaskaskia became the capital of Illinois Territory until Illinois became a state in 1819. It was the state capital for a year, until the powers that be thought it safer to move the capital to Vandalia. It didnâ€™t help that the Mississippi River refused to cooperate: â€œAs the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which primarily lies within the boundaries of the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old channel is regularly flooded and has a bridge to carry traffic over it.â€ (Wikipedia) [20120907-163954] [20120907-181523] [20120907-181719] [20120907-181840] [20120907-184223] [20120907-184323] [20120907-184429] [20120907-184836]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;However, by the time we had made our way to almost the extreme southern end of Illinois, the weather, which had been threatening most of the day, turned bad and we saw some pretty scary flashes of lightening and had a couple of heavy downpours. There are several historic sites in the area, including the sites of French forts. There was also a sign for a river ferry, which would have been a great experience, but we werenâ€™t sure that it would even run in a bad thunderstorm. So instead of going back up State Route 3 for a couple of miles to the ferry, we decided to continue south on route 3 where there would be a bridge across the Mississippi at Chester, Ill. As it happened, Chester has a pretty nice visitor center, which was already closed for the day, but we could still use the restrooms and we even took our lives in our hands by venturing out on the viewing platform overlooking the river and the bridge Lighting flashing all around water and a metal bridge; probably not the safest spot, eh? But one has to have pictures. We also learned that the creator of Popeye the Sailorman was a native of Chester, so that the town claims the cartoon hero as an honorary citizen. By the time we had the necessary pictures, we knew we had to get to shelter, and quickly. The sky had turned slate gray, with some patches of a sickly green and lighting was practically continuous. Missouri does get pretty bad tornadoes sometimes, and I know that if the sky had looked like that in Ellicott City, I would have gone into the basement for sure. So I drove quickly but carefully to Perryville, MO. where we found a Days Inn with yet another acre of bed and a Chinese buffet next door. Weâ€™ll visit the town (hamlet?) of Kaskaskia tomorrow, and then weâ€™ll go on to St. Louis and the Arch.','2012-09-08 03:30:38','D','2012-09-08 03:11:01','N'),('20120908B0001','nicoline','20120908','The Gateway Arch, St. Louis','We thought weâ€™d change things up a little and stay at a Baymont Inn instead of a Days Inn, but Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a step up on the Wyndham ladder, as their paperwork suggests. Their internet is slow as molasses in January. I can just about check facebook and email and then itâ€™s tired and needs a rest. It also wonâ€™t let me log into Ericâ€™s laptop, which is a great bore, because I have a picture that tells the history of the Eastern half of the United States in a nutshell. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As I said, we drove out to Kaskaskia from Perryville, MO, this morning. Eric wanted to have the pleasure of driving into St. Louis from the east, which required a drive back into Illinois anyway, so it didnâ€™t make much difference where weâ€™d cross the Mississippi. The land was somewhat flat, but not completely so, until we got to what I suppose youâ€™d call a bayou. Itâ€™s basically a part of the river thatâ€™s dry land under normal conditions but it floods without any encouragement at all. We couldnâ€™t believe how Dutch it looked, coming up on a low dike and then standing on top looking over flat land as far as the eye can see. Even the wind was Dutch, definitely on the nippy side and Iâ€™m sure that had we tried to bike there, we would have had headwind no matter which direction we went. &lf;&nl;[20120908-093347] [20120908-093646] [20120908-094526] [20120908-094703] [20120908-095014] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At any rate, we drove to the town of Kaskaskia, where we saw the bell that Louis XV donated to the citizens in the first half of the 18th century (without pictures I canâ€™t check the dates, dang it!) so they could put it in their church. It now hangs in a little chapel, which was unfortunately closed, but we could look inside it. A little ways down the road is the church of Kaskaskia, very European looking also, with an all-brick steeple, instead of the white wooden New England-looking ones weâ€™re used to here. The place was and is French, down to the fleur de lis on the church steps, and we were not surprised to find that it was a Catholic church. Kaskaskia consists of a grid of nine streets, along most of which we walked because it was such a nice, fresh day and not at all muggy. During our walk we saw exactly one person, who greeted us but made no attempt at conversation, and two dogs. That was it. So we got back in the car and drove out along La Grande Rue in the opposite direction of how weâ€™d driven in.  [20120908-095047] [20120908-095141] [20120908-095232] [20120908-095438] [20120908-095633] [20120908-095726] [20120908-100117] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Pretty soon we ended up at the little dike again. No signs said we couldnâ€™t drive up to the top and over it into a farm road, so thatâ€™s what we did for all of about 100 ft. I could feel the car slipping and sliding as I drove at barely a walk, so I told Eric I wasnâ€™t going to go any farther and get hopelessly bogged down in thick mud. I intended to turn, but Eric didnâ€™t think the sides of the road would hold up at all, so in the end I just put the car in reverse and drove out backward. We didnâ€™t get stuck, but it took quite a while for the wheels to shed the mud. [20120908-101819] [20120908-102813] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We decided that maybe weâ€™d better return to civilization and paved roads, so we took La Grande Rue back past Kaskaskia and out towards Ste. GeneviÃ¨ve, where there was supposed to be a ferry across the Mississippi. And thatâ€™s where Eric took the picture Iâ€™m talking about. A sign post bearing a street sign saying â€œLa Grande Rueâ€ intersecting with  â€œN. Kingâ€™s Highway.\" If thatâ€™s not a perfect metaphor for 18th century American history, I donâ€™t know what is. [20120908-094506]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we drove onto Ste.  GeneviÃ¨ve, wondering how the locals pronounced it. Despite 15 years in Maryland and 17 years in the country, when I come across a very French name like that, I pronounce it the way the French would (despite my mistreatment of the the Gallic language, of course). It took me years to remember that Montpellier is pronounced MontPELE-ear, instead of Monpel-YAY. As it turns out, Ste.  GeneviÃ¨ve is the oldest permanent European settlement in Missouri, founded ca. 1735, according to Wikipedia, and the natives pronounce it Saint Geneveef. A shame to mistreat a beautiful name like that, but there it is. Itâ€™s a charming little town that we spent a little while exploring. I think w sometimes forget, or choose not to remember, that the French are just as much part of our history as the English and Germans.  It&apos;s great to be able to travel wherever we fancy instead of having to stick to a set schedule. So what if that means we sometimes fall a little behind?

The clerk at the welcome center, who was probably all of 25 years old, said he didnâ€™t remember it ever been as low as it is now. So we ended up driving back into Missouri and up I-55 to loop back to a point where we could pick up I-70 west to St. Louis. I drove, and Eric snapped picture after picture, which you arenâ€™t going to get to see until we get to a place with decent internet, Iâ€™m afraid. Or until the morning, when most people are busy eating breakfast or checking out and not hogging bandwith :-) [20120908-113226] [20120908-113337] [20120908-123857] [20120908-125934] [20120908-130225] [20120908-130231] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We quickly found parking near the Arch and walked to the visitor center thatâ€™s below ground. Security was pretty tight. The Park Service even made people take off their belts. We bought tickets for the 1.30 showing of a movie about Lewis and Clark, the 2.25 tram ride to the top of the arch and a 4 p.m. showing of a documentary about how the Arch was built. The movie was made by National Geographic and featured absolutely breathtaking nature scenes: rivers, prairies, mountains, glaciers, and oceans. Stunning. Itâ€™s worth a visit to the Arch just to see that movie. [20120908-130231] [20120908-151305] [20120908-151330] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;President Jefferson, Lewis and Clark may have believed that there was plenty of space for white settlement and that Native Americans and whites could co-exist peacefully, but they were quite wrong. Probably no one set out to start a war, but just consider this: St. Louis had 500 residents in 1803, when Lewis and Clark set out toward the Pacific. By the time of the Mexican War, the town had over 47,000 residents! The whole history of westward expansion is beautifully laid out in the museum of westward expansion. Not as slickly produced, perhaps, as the show at the Lincoln Museum, but more authentic and probably more authoritative. I didnâ€™t read every single panel, but thereâ€™s a whole wall devoted to a timeline of westward expansion, plus different tableaux with â€œmovingâ€ and â€œtalkingâ€ mannequins and what looked to be real historical artifacts. [20120908-153458] [20120908-154909] [20120908-095117]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The documentary about the building of the Arch is also well-worth seeing, especially if you are an engineer. I just like it for architect Saarinenâ€™s conceptualization and for the drama of making all the pieces fit together exactly so. At 630 ft. the Arch is the highest of all  monuments in the country and itâ€™s made out of a specially made steel sections clad in stainless steel from Pittsburgh that were shipped out to St. Louis by train and that were welded together in place. The people who worked on it cannot have suffered from vertigo, since most of them appeared to go about their jobs almost without any safety precautions. No one seemed to use safety harnesses, though they did wear hard hats. Nevertheless, the Arch was completed without the loss of a single life. [20120908-163616] [20120908-170839] [20120908-171647] [20120908-171827] [20120908-174752]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We meant to go on to the Old Courthouse, which is part of the Arch National Park, even though itâ€™s two blocks away. But that had already closed. Itâ€™s the site of the first two trials in the Dred Scott case, before it came before the Supreme Court. The court itself is in the process of being refurbished on the outside and we decided we didnâ€™t want to stick around St. Louis until tomorrow to wait for the museum to open. After all, the facts of the Dred Scott case are fairly well-known and you can easily find whatever you need to know about it on the internet. So we had a little picnic at the base of the Arch and then got back in the car to drive out west toward southern Missouri. After two hours of driving, we decided to call it a day. The Baymont Inn has a pool and we treated ourselves to some R&amp;R in the pool and the hot tub.

[20120909-103536] [20120909-113619] [20120909-114409] [20120909-121343] [20120909-124048] [20120909-131233] [20120909-131413] [20120909-131556] [20120909-164505] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Nowadays when I see people traveling with their kids, I wonder how we did stuff way back when. Mark turned five on the trip to South Dakota - we had a party at the indoor adventure park at Mall of America, where they also had a great Lego thingamajig, with Lego constructions big enough for a little guy to sit on. Even before that, we traveled with them not only from Holland to the U.S. by way of Heathrow Airport and by car from Short Hills, NJ, to Charleston, SC because I not only had a Little House itch but also a Civil War itch. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I do remember that we brought breakfast cereal with us, buying milk at a gas station early in the morning and fixing coffee in the room, to save both money and time. Motels usually didnâ€™t offer breakfast, or if they did it would be just doughnuts and danishes, unsuitable for kids who will need to sit still in the car for a couple of hours. For lunch and dinner we mostly ate out, even if it was only at McDonaldâ€™s, and even there we had rules. The kids could not have soda, and they had to finish their meal before they were allowed to get up off the table. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We used to tell them that â€œthe Romans [as in the ancients] lay down at the table with their heads propped up on their arms and they ate like pigsâ€ to avoid charging any one nationality with having atrocious table manners. You know how it is with kids. Tell them the Moldovians have terrible table manners and theyâ€™re bound to make the acquaintance of a bunch of Moldovan kids in the pool at the next motel and mortally offend the parents by proclaiming loudly that their table manners are deplorable. Anyway. They would have to sit up straight and eat with appropriate utensils. No getting up and running around. Iâ€™m pretty sure whining was also a no-no, but it was probably unavoidable sometimes after long hours in the car. But theyâ€™d be in bed at approximately their regular bed time, tucked into one of the queen beds after a story from â€œJip and Jannekeâ€ while Eric and I shared the other one. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;People donâ€™t seem to have figured out a way how to keep their kids under control or even how to get them to eat without getting food all over themselves or the table. No one ever seems to tell their kid â€œDonâ€™t put your shoes on the seat; other people have to sit there, you know!â€ and yesterday in Rolla, the three-year-old blithely ran up and down the pool area without his mother even attempting to say â€œDonâ€™t run!â€ on account of slick floor tiles. Of course it isnâ€™t my business to say anything, so I just bite my tongue and hope he doesnâ€™t fall flat on his face and howl. Iâ€™m just glad we donâ€™t have to travel with little kids anymore. We just get the room with the king bed and enjoy the peace and quiet! Tonight&apos;s rest will be particularly blessed, I&apos;m sure, since the motel is housed in what certainly looks like a former church to me.

I&apos;m sure the ladies meant well, but I&apos;m afraid I was a bit put-off by their presentations.

The Lewis and Clark expedition featured prominently, of course, but there were a lot of other exhibits which pressed home how remarkable it was for people (men, women, families) 150 years ago to pack up everything and \"go West\"... including the diary of a gold digger.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120910-135028] [20120910-135340] [20120910-135407] [20120910-134558] [20120910-141200] [20120910-140853]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Independence it wasn&apos;t far into Kansas City.

We hoped to see the Power and Light district, but I guess there wasn&apos;t much worth seeing on a Monday afternoon... We concluded our visit to Kansas City on State Line Road, a road that sits right on top of the border between Kansas and Missouri. So if you drive south on that road, you&apos;re in Kansas; if you turn around and drive north, you&apos;re in Missouri.

The weather was absolutely gorgeous, 70 degrees and sunny with a slight breeze, which helped. After that we showered and went for breakfast. It was one of these motels that are run as a family enterprise and they clearly donâ€™t believe in spending a penny too much. The faucet in our bathroom worked, but it was held in place with gobs of silicon or something similar and at the breakfast buffet there wasnâ€™t a basket of single-serving packets of oatmeal like you usually see, but just a large container of Quaker Oats (old-fashioned, too, not even the quick stuff), as though they were saying â€œWhat are you complaining about? Thereâ€™s oatmeal, isnâ€™t there? Well, then!â€ But, in defense of the Days Inn at Concordia, MO, I will say that their internet was pretty good. [20120910-091018]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we were soon on our way to see another Madonna of the Trail, this one in Lexington, MO. As it happens, Lexington seems like a pretty pleasant town. It not only has a library and a bookstore/coffee shop right next to one another, but also a second hand book store. Pretty impressive, for a small town of some 4,400 people, even if the second-hand bookstore was closed. I had some cards to mail, so I walked back into the town center to find a mailbox while Eric took pictures and I came across the historic courthouse, where there is a monument to the Pony Express that started there in the late 19th century and right next to it is a sign for the Santa Fe Trail, for which Lexington was a jumping-off point. The courthouse was damaged in the Civil War and to this day a cannon ball from 1861 is embedded in one of the pillars. They also have a monument to the countyâ€™s war dead which I thought was particularly nice because it made a point of including sailors in the merchant marine and National Guardsmen, who sometimes tend to be overlooked.

Instead, we meandered our way to Independence, MO via the Missouri 224 scenic byway. It was a very pretty drive and itâ€™s nice to drive at a lower speed so you can have the windows open without the noise driving you crazy. Eric and I are probably never going to agree on that! Iâ€™m always hot and he thinks itâ€™s on the nippy side if it isnâ€™t 80 degrees out. [20120910-104306] [20120910-104401] [20120910-110330]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We were a little late getting to the Truman Presidential Library and Museum, but itâ€™s not like weâ€™re running a race or anything, so we took the time to watch the introductory movie. Not really anything new, of course, but itâ€™s fun to see anyway, even if we probably saw the same movie when we visited in 2002. Incidentally, the museum also has a Thomas Hart Benton mural. From the Truman Library website: \"Benton began work on the mural in early 1960, three years after the founding of the Truman Library. Out of the mural, a deep and lasting friendship emerged between two of Missouri&apos;s most famous sons. In one account, Benton, high on the scaffolding, was listening to the comments of his chief critic and patron below, President Truman. Finally Benton called down, &apos;If you want to help paint, come up here.&apos; &apos;By golly, I will,&apos; Truman replied. He climbed up to the platform, seized a brush and began dabbing blue on the sky. Occasions like this, made the President and the artist lifelong friends.\"  We toured the exhibits, and I found out that the Trumans actually visited Amsterdam after he had left the White House. We ate lunch on a picnic bench outside the museum - finally finished the awful Aldi bagels, yay! - before heading to the National Frontier Trails Museum, just a few blocks south of the Truman Library. Itâ€™s on a site where there used to be a flour mill owned by the family of Mrs. Truman, but it burned down in the 1960s.[20120910-112826] [20120910-121618] [20120910-121807] [20120910-122417] [20120910-132651]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Independence was a jumping off point for pioneers setting off on any of three trails (four, if you count the Mormon Trail): The Santa Fe, Oregon and California Trails. When we arrived we were the only people there, and we had the movie theater all to ourselves, but as we began looking at the exhibits other people came in. Itâ€™s a bit creepy to be in a museum all by yourself. The museum has a pretty good exhibit on Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery and then goes on to show why people chose to migrate along any of the three trails. [20120910-135028] [20120910-135351] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There are probably as many reasons as there are people who migrated, but one of the things that struck me was that it actually had a pretty high success rate. Some 90 percent of those who made any of those three journeys arrived at their destination. Not without plenty of trouble along the way, of course. Disease and weather claimed their share of victims, as did attacks by Native Americans, although that became a problem relatively late in the history of the trails, and not until after treaties made with various tribes had been broken. Often they had to dump some or all of their treasures that they meant to bring along to their new homes along the way to lighten the load and wagons and animals sometimes broke down as well. Iâ€™m still trying to wrap my head around what possessed people to make such a long and hazardous journey. Looking at the Lewis and Clark movie at the Arch two days ago and seeing some of their exploits highlighted here at the National Frontier Trails Museum, plus all the thousands who made the journey later, we feel singularly unaccomplished. What sort of people were they? They must have been made of sterner stuff than we are.  [20120910-141200] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Frontier Trails Museum we drove on into Kansas City because we wanted to see the Kansas City, KS,  libraryâ€™s parking garage that looks like a shelf of books. I donâ€™t know who came up with the idea to plant trees in the one spot where they shouldnâ€™t be, because half the bookshelf is obscured by them! Then we walked around the Power and Light District, which is supposed to be shopping and entertainment center. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s lots going on there on the weekend, but as we happened to be there on a Monday afternoon, we didnâ€™t see any of it. We did walk past the Kansas City convention center where there was some kind of conference of actuaries going on. That must be fun :-) [20120910-150454] [20120910-150536] [20120910-150551] [20120910-151125] [20120910-151703] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On August 26, I came across an article in the New York Times that described off-beat places to visit and things to see, and it happened to mention the State Line Road, which divides Kansas City, MO from Kansas City, KS and was the site of pitched battles between pro-slavery forces and abolitionists during the â€œBleeding Kansasâ€ years. In 1820, the Missouri Compromise had stipulated that new states should be added to the Union in pairs, so that the balance between slave states and free states would be preserved. Missouri was at the western end of a belt of states that were above the 36 degrees 30â€™ parallel, above which slavery would no longer be permitted in new territories. Slave states that sat above that line are Kentucky, , the part of Virginia that is now West-Virginia, Maryland and Delaware.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the compromise by allowing the inhabitants of a territory to decide whether they wanted to be a slave state or a free state. Since Kansas could go either way, a lot of pro-slavery whites, known as border ruffians, moved into Kansas to help decide the question in favor of slavery. Pro-slavery and abolitionist forces sometimes fought pitched battles, such as the one fought by John Brown and his men against Henry Clay Pate on the Black Jack Battlefield near present-day Ottawa and Osawatomie, KS, in 1856 and in. Weâ€™ll visit the John Brown historic site in Osawatomie tomorrow.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It is decidedly disconcerting to drive down State Line Road today. Thereâ€™s nothing to remind you of its contentious, not to say bloody, history. In fact, it looks just as suburban as Columbia, MD. The only thing is that on one side of the street all the cars have Missouri license plates and on the other side the University of Kansas Medical Center dominates the landscape. I wonder if the two states (and the 15 counties that make up the Kansas City metropolitan area) have some sort of cooperation agreement to run Kansas City as a single municipality? Imagine the hassles trying to figure out whether you should speak to the county or the city on the east or west of the line!  [20120910-155908] [20120910-155158] [20120910-155136] [20120910-155513] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, State Line Road was pretty unexciting to look at, so we turned to find our way back to I-70 west and from there down Kansas route 7 toward Osawatomie. Unfortunately, that is farther away than we thought it would be, so in the end we decided to stay in Olathe, KS. We had no idea how to pronounce it and there are several possibilities, so I asked the desk clerk. He said itâ€™s pronounced O-LA-tha, with an â€œaâ€ at the end. I didnâ€™t feel like asking why. Iâ€™ve also been mispronouncing Osawatomie. I thought it was OsawaTOmie, but itâ€™s actually OsaWAtomie. Just so you know. Because we got to the motel rather early I decided to do a load of laundry, which took me about an hour or so. I feel very virtuous, also because I had brought two microwavable meals which we heated and ate and which were actually quite edible.

For this entry, now that we&apos;re about 2,000 miles into the journey, I wanted to talk a little bit about other stuff, how this trip is going and how I&apos;m experiencing it.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We have established a bit of a pattern, in that each day, we start out with breakfast at the hotel, go back to the room to brush teeth and pack the car, check out, and get on the road. Nicoline and I alternate in driving; some days, she starts out, other days, I start out, and we switch after two to three hours of driving, however it works out.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We don&apos;t have a specific schedule, only a list of ideas of things that might be interesting to visit, and we are continuously open to surprises. For instance, today we took a stroll around Lexington, which was on our list because of the Madonna monument, but we didn&apos;t expect it to be such a nice little town. Later, we went to the National Frontier Trails Museum because we happened to pick up a flier from them at the hotel.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Whenever we visit a place, we don&apos;t spend a whole lot of time. Many places that we visited are interesting enough to spend a couple of days in each, and of course, that doesn&apos;t work with the schedule we&apos;re having. So we mostly get an impression of a place rather than a thorough analysis. But all the impressions are adding up to an interesting picture indeed.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;What this trip is doing is helping us understand better the psyche of the American people. On longer stretches we listed to books on tape (using Nicoline&apos;s phone as an MP3 player and \"Koala\" as the speaker). [20120910-091315] The first book we listened to was <em>The Big Roads</em> and now we&apos;re listening to <em>Why Nations Fail - The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty</em>. It turns out that these books are surprisingly relevant to our trip, and what we see on this trip helps understand the books.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<em>The Big Roads</em> book was about how highways and interstates came to be in the United States, how they changes society but how society also changed them. It was about how roads are constructed, where the ideas come from, how decisions are made as to where which roads go, and so on. Since we are actually driving on exactly the roads that the book is talking about, there is an obvious direct connection.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<em>Why Nations Fail</em> is about the American entrepreneurial spirit, how individuals in America made history not because they were born in important families, but because they created something with their own hands. What we&apos;re seeing in the monuments and museums we&apos;re visiting is exactly that: how people got up and did something.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Meanwhile, we&apos;re driving through all these small towns, sometimes with a population of only a few hundred people, and all the time past the farm houses that are sprinkled on the landscape, and it becomes clear that there is a huge part of American still here in the middle, not in the big cities we&apos;re accustomed to on the East Coast or the West Coast. Although I don&apos;t think I can really imagine what it is to grow up in these small towns, the diversity of American society is tarting to make more sense.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;These are the kind of things I am contemplating while we drive through America...&lf;&nl;','2012-09-11 02:01:55','D','2012-09-11 02:01:55','N'),('20120911D0001','nicoline','20120911','Capitals and constitutions','Iâ€™ve kind of lost track of the date. It wasnâ€™t until I saw flags flying at half-staff everywhere that I realized it must be September 11. Strange to think itâ€™s been 11 years already. The sky today was as bright blue as it was then, and it was pretty warm even though we got an early start. We were in the car by 8:30 and arrived at the John Brown Memorial Park before the museum even opened. [20120911-084658] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The park was open, so we just walked around and read all the information on the signs. Some appeared to have been put up just recently, maybe in preparation for the festival next weekend. And because we were very quiet and stood quiet still, Eric got a couple of really nice shots of a squirrel. OK, I know squirrels are no big deal, but still. [20120911-091349] [20120911-092613]  [20120911-092809] [20120911-093004] [20120911-092415] [20120911-092329] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When the museum opened at 10, the site superintendent showed us in and gave us some information about the place. The stone building that houses the museum is actually built right over the log cabin that housed John Brownâ€™s half-sister and her husband, Samuel Adair and Florella Brown Adair, who were both also involved in abolitionist work and had both been educated at Oberlin College in Ohio, a hotbed of abolitionism. In addition to housing the Adairs and their two children, it also housed John Brown and five of his sons (he had 20 children in total by two wives) and served as a station on the underground railroad. Brown and his sons attacked a group of pro-slavery settlers in May 1856 and on August 30, a pro-slavery militia led by John Reid attacked John Brownâ€™s group in retaliation, resulting in the battle of Osawatomie. [20120911-095801] [20120911-100450] [20120911-100711] [20120911-102255]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Reidâ€™s men then proceeded to loot and burn the town of Osawatomie, which did the pro-slavery cause a lot of harm in the court of public opinion. As a result of the battle of Osawatomie, John Brown gained fame - or notoriety, depending on your point of view - throughout the United States and became known as Old Osawatomie Brown. He used this new-found fame to plan the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, which involved robbing a federal arsenal to arm the slaves so they would rise up in a massive revolt and overthrown the government. This plan was foiled by Col. Robert E. Lee of the U.S. Army and Brown was hanged for treason on December 2, 1859. The last words he wrote were: â€œI, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.â€ The Civil War, which is still the bloodiest war the U.S. has ever fought, began less than two years later, hence the slogan on the billboard outside town: â€œCradle of the Civil War.â€ [20120911-085744]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Osawatomie we backtracked along state route 7, because there was supposed to be a Olathe Visitors Bureau on 106th street where we thought they might have a road map of Kansas of the kind you normally get at a state welcome center. Kansas only has one welcome center, and itâ€™s located at the western end of I-70 in the state. We preferred to get a map before leaving the state, but unfortunately we could not find 106th street. The numbers went from 119th to 83rd street with nothing in between. By now it was about noon, so we stopped at a grocery store to pick up some stuff for lunch and dinner and any meal in between. We had lunch right in the parking lot, because we were famished, and those baguettes with blueberry Stilton and yoghurt for desert sure tasted good, even if the other shoppers probably thought we were crazy. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After  lunch we proceeded to follow state route 7 into Ft. Leavenworth, thinking weâ€™d be sure to see signs for the Buffalo Soldiers Monument and the site of the fort that was home to the black cavalry regiment first authorized by Congress in 1866. That didnâ€™t quite work out. We did find a marker for the place where the first landing that later became Ft. Leavenworth was located, but nothing else. A website for <a href= \"http://garrison.leavenworth.army.mil/Visitors/History/BuffaloSoldier/Buffalo_Soldier_History.asp\">Ft. Leavenworth </a>  says that the monument to the Buffalo Soldiers wasnâ€™t dedicated until June 25, 1992, when Colin L. Powell was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the first black man to serve as such. Better late than never, I suppose. Anyway, we gave up the hunt and decided to follow the Kansas Turnpike, which coincides with I-70 for a bit, to see if we could find a service center where there might be stack of Kansas highway maps available. As it turned out, the only service center on the turnpike was one that had a gas station and a fast food place and a whole bunch of touristy junk for sale, but no frigginâ€™ highway maps or any other kind of useful information. That had to wait until we got off the turnpike in Lawrence and found a place where they not only had maps galore but a very helpful lady at the information desk who helped us find a bunch of stuff. They even had a display called â€œaround I-70â€!

After he retired from the Senate, Mr. Dole donated his papers to the university and it built the Robert J. Dole Center for Politics to house a research library and museum. Itâ€™s as close as he got to a presidential library, I suppose. One of its windows is a giant stained-glass American flag, very appropriate for 9/11, especially since the window is flanked by two sections of I-beams from the World Trade Center. [20120911-150954]  [20120911-151341] [20120911-152400]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Having learned at the John Brown Memorial Park that Kansas had no fewer than 8 state capitals and 4 constitutions, we were eager to see at least one of them. One of the brochures we picked up in Osawatomie said that Ft. Riley, which was the state capital for a few days (!) happened to be closed, so we settled for Lecompton, where the 1857 pro-slavery constitution was created.  According to the <a href= \"http://skyways.lib.ks.us/history/capital.html\">Kansas Historical Society </a> the first capital was an office at Ft. Leavenworth. The next year, in 1855, the legislature met at Ft. Riley, but after 5 days it moved to the Shawnee Methodist Mission near Kansas City. In 1857 it met at Lecompton (see above) and Lawrence. In 1859 the Wyandotte Constitution named Topeka as its temporary capital. It was under this constitution that Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861. In the next election Topeka was voted the permanent state capital, although the state house wasnâ€™t ready for occupation until 1869 and not completely finished until 1903. I suppose you could count Topeka twice, once because it was only the temporary capital and another time when it was voted the permanent capital, in which case you come to 8 capitals. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The history of Kansasâ€™ <a href= &apos;https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/kansas-constitutions/16532&apos;> constitutions </a> is equally convoluted. Depending on whether pro-slavery or abolitionists (free-staters) were in the ascendant, Kansas territory legislators debated constitutions in Pawnee (slavery), Lawrence and Big Spring (free-staters), leading to a constitution approved on December 15 that forbade slavery but also did not allow free blacks to settle in the state. Congress disapproved and rejected Kansasâ€™ application to be admitted to the Union. The next constitutional debate took place in Lecompton. The pro-slavery constitution it produced was submitted to the people to â€œ...vote [...] on a special slavery article only: in other words, â€˜for the constitution with slaveryâ€™ or â€˜for the constitution without slavery.â€™ Because a vote â€˜for the constitution without slaveryâ€™ meant Kansans could keep the slaves they already owned, freestaters refused to participate. On December 21, the â€˜constitution with slaveryâ€™ won 6,226 to 569.â€ Meanwhile, the governor had called the legislature into special session on December 7, to schedule another vote on the Lecompton constitution. This time, it was defeated. The debate on the third constitution took place at Ft. Leavenworth in March 1858. It was the most radical document so far. According to the Kansas Historical Society, â€œThe word â€˜whiteâ€™ did not appear in this proposed document, and it would not have excluded free â€˜Negroes and mulattoesâ€™ from the state. The Leavenworth Constitution was ratified on May 18, 1858.â€ Finally, the legislature, now firmly under the control of free-staters, met in Wyandotte to debate yet another constitution. The document was adopted and signed on July 29 and was finally approved by voters on October 4, 1859. This is the the constitution that allowed Kansas to be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1861.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We didnâ€™t learn any of this in Lecompton, though, because all of its historic sites are open only from Wednesday through Saturday.

So we turned picked up I-70 at Topeka and drove to an exit where the signs promised motels galore. First we drove a couple of miles north: No  motels. We did, however, come to a beautiful scenic overlook. Then we drove back and a couple of miles south of the interstate: still no motels. By then we were about halfway to Council Grove, where a Madonna of the Trail was waiting, so we decided to drive all the way down there, hoping thereâ€™d be some sort of motel or hotel. And there was, but it didnâ€™t offer internet. So we settled down with Doritos and M&amp;Ms for dinner and a book instead of a laptop. And you know what: It was quite restful.

Getting frustrated with not having found a welcome center for Kansas yet, and not having a highway map, we went back to the I-70 and stopped at the first service center. They still didn&apos;t have the Kansas state highway map, although they did have coffee tables that are, let&apos;s say, an acquired taste...

[20120912-093249]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One of the flyers was hardly even a flyer, but more like thin book of beautiful pictures and descriptions of scenic drives available around I-70 called â€œScenic Byways of Kansas.â€ Since we happened to notice a sign pointing to U.S. 56 on our run, we decided to start with the Prairie Trail. It did not disappoint. We drove down state route 77 to get to Canton and while that wasnâ€™t part of the scenic route per se, it was a beautiful drive all the same, especially, since the sky was darkening with rain.

Itâ€™s a nature reserve begun by the brother John Gault and Henry Irving (the information kiosk at the observation tower apparently misspells his name) Maxwell. According to the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, it all started in â€œ...1859 when Henry Gault Maxwell drove a small herd of bison to the area and established a homestead.â€ Mr. Maxwell was either already married and brought his wife with him to Kansas, or married after settling there. At any rate, he had two sons, John, Jr. and Henry. â€œAfter the elder Maxwellâ€™s death, his two sons became successful businessmen and never forgot their fatherâ€™s dream. The last surviving son, Henry Irving Maxwell, crafted his will to fulfill his fatherâ€™s vision. In 1943, Henry Irving Maxwellâ€™s estate began purchasing land to create a wildlife refuge. In 1944, 2,560 acres were deeded to what is now the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP), which created the refuge.â€ In addition to buffalo there are supposed to be elk, but we didnâ€™t see the latter. We spend a good twenty minutes looking all around us from the tower and then came down to have a picnic lunch in the shade of the kiosk. Even with the strong wind, it was hot enough to make us seek shade.

Coronado Park was constructed under the Works Progress Administration in 1936, so almost 400 years after Coronadoâ€™s journey. I donâ€™t know if they planted the grasses and other vegetation to bring to mind the southwest and Spanish conquistadores and all that or whether they grow there naturally, but both Eric and I were strongly reminded of New Mexico and Arizona, which we visited in 2007. It must be because weâ€™re traveling in the off-season, but Coronado Park is such a beautiful spot that we simply couldnâ€™t understand why it there wasnâ€™t a crowd of people!

Instead of heading west on I-70 we headed east, to get back to Abilene. Itâ€™s the hometown of President Eisenhower, so we wanted to visit the presidential library and museum. We started with a 24-minute movie in the visitorsâ€™ center, which was so condensed that it left out Ikeâ€™s command of Allied force that landed in North-Africa in 1942. Then we took a tour of his boyhood home. The guide, who had clearly conducted this tour about 9 million times and could recite it in his sleep, said that everything that was in the house was there when Mrs. Ida Eisenhower, Ikeâ€™s mother, died in 1946. I was looking at the book case in the parlor and noticed a New Testament in Syriac (presumably one in Syriac with an English translation next to it, or I wouldnâ€™t have been able to read the title), so I asked who read that. Itâ€™s not a language that one expects to find in Abilene. As it turns out, both Ikeâ€™s parents were educated and later married at Lane University, a Church of the United Brethren in Christ school (some Mennonite faction, I presume) in Lecompton. According to Wikipedia, Lane University merged with Campbell University in 1902 to form Campbell College.

The rash usually appears as red, tiny bumps or slightly raised patches of skin.â€ This according to the Mayo Clinic.

It jumps around quite a bit and you donâ€™t really see the progression of events. Thatâ€™s unnecessary, because if anybodyâ€™s story is fairly well-known, itâ€™s Ikeâ€™s. The museum did, however, pay attention to the role of television in Ikeâ€™s 1952 presidential campaign, even if he resented being sold like a box of detergent, as I think heâ€™s quoted in David Halberstamâ€™s book â€œThe Fifties.â€ [20120913-095232] [20120913-095209] [20120913-095828]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Abilene we drove to Lucas, where Eric particularly wanted to see the Garden of Eden.

That particular area of Kansas has a layer of limestone about a foot below the earth and because there were few or no trees in the area, early settlers figured out pretty soon that they could quarry this comparatively soft stone fairly easily and use it for everything youâ€™d normally use wood for. One use that figures prominently in the area is as fence posts. Thereâ€™s even a scenic drive called the Post Rock drive. We didnâ€™t seek it out for its scenic qualities, but on the way to Lucas from I-70 we stopped at a dam where they had also used limestone and a sign explained the particular qualities of the stone. [20120913-114143] [20120913-114209] [20120913-114230]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, once inside the faux log cabin we got a tour which explained that S.P. Dinsmore built the cottage and the sculptures as a way to fund his retirement from farming in 1907. His statues are not just statues, but also social and political commentary. Dinsmore was by all accounts a guy who went his own way. For example, he built a mausoleum where he wanted to bury his first wifeâ€™s remains (after she died, he remarried at age 80 or thereabouts to a woman who was about a quarter his age!)  but town ordinances forbade this. So he buried her in the town cemetery, but one night secretly dug her up and interred her in the mausoleum, where he encased her casket in concrete, so no one could get at it anymore. His second wife complained of being left alone all the time while he was out in the yard working on his concrete sculptures, so he made a little statue of a guy looking into the kitchen window (the kitchen and dining room are in the basement of the house) to make her feel like she had company. [20120913-120025] [20120913-122447] [20120913-122712] [20120913-123419] [20120913-124346] [20120913-124528] [20120913-124536] [20120913-124430]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But the statue I like best is the one he left unfinished because he went blind in the last two years before his death. It depicts a worker (labor) being crucified by four money-sucking fellows: a doctor, a preacher, a lawyer and a banker. Pretty incisive commentary for the early 20th century and still relevant today! [20120913-123507]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The tour guide also urged us to visit the Grassroots Arts Center, and because we like to just go places on a whim, we did. We were not disappointed! The things people can make out of what most of us would consider to be worthless junk. And to our surprise, it included stuff we had come across on our <a href=\"http://www.grivel.net/around/diary.php?day=20070805\">2007 trip</a>, which was also somewhere in Kansas. It was there that I found the perfect souvenir of our trip: another little monkey.

I donâ€™t remember ever being in a public restroom where you are more interested in the decor than in doing your business and getting out. Due to the townâ€™s quirky nature, the public restroom is shaped like a giant toilet, with the path leading to it an unwinding roll of toilet paper. Inside, the ladiesâ€™ and gents restrooms are decorated quite differently. Since nobody else was there, Eric went into the ladiesâ€™ room to take pictures while I admired the decor in the menâ€™s room. Extraordinary. [20120913-134545] [20120913-134547] [20120913-134649] [20120913-134655] [20120913-134710] [20120913-134743] [20120913-134753] [20120913-134849] [20120913-134923] [20120913-135008] [20120913-135106]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By now it was nearly 2 p.m. and we wanted to get to Hays, to see historic Fort Hays. On the way there, we noticed while some people may not be in Kansas anymore, Waldo is definitely there. So you can stop inquiring as to his whereabouts. [20120913-141316]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Fort Hays was one of a number of frontier forts established to protect migrants on the Smoky River Trail and travelers on the Butterfield Overland Diepatch stagecoach to Denver. It was home to the 7th Cavalry, General Custerâ€™s outfit that met such an unfortunate fate at Little Big Horn in what is now Montana, and to the Buffalo Soldiers.  It even had its very own \"Lady with the lamp.\" [20120913-152129] [20120913-153440] [20120913-153514] [20120913-154932] [20120913-155135] [20120913-160239]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Our idea of a frontier fort is all wrong. I remember having a Playmobil set of a fort and soldiers and horses and stuff, and it definitely included a stockade, complete with towers. For one thing, there usually was no stockade, because there wouldnâ€™t have been enough trees in the area to build one. Also, the wide open spaces of Kansas made it unlikely that anyone, least of all a party of Native American braves on the war path, could sneak up on the fort. And Native Americans werenâ€™t so stupid as to attack a fort when guerilla tactics were far more effective and less dangerous to them: lightning attacks on small parties of settlers or isolated groups of soldiers on a scouting mission etc. By the mid-1880s the Native American population had become so diminished that there was no longer a need for all the forts, so most of them were closed. Some, such as Ft. Riley and Ft. Leavenworth, remain active military installations to this day, though. [20120913-160354] [20120913-160819] [20120913-161506] [20120913-162434] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Fort Hays we decided to take the Smoky Hills scenic drive. According to the Kansas Byways website, the â€œSmoky Hills Trail was established at the Civil Warâ€™s end to carry goods and travelers, including bona fide gold diggers, from Fort Leavenworth to Denver. Although it provided the shortest route to Denver, the trail was considered dangerous, and travel often required the protection of troops stationed at nearby Fort Hays.â€ It was a beautiful drive, even though we didnâ€™t see very many wildflowers. Possibly September is a bit late in the year for that. We did see birds, though. I think it was Thoreau who said that you canâ€™t be truly free unless you can look at a free horizon as much as you want, and heâ€™s right. As much as Maryland is home, we just donâ€™t have that kind of space in Maryland.

[20120913-115645] We had no idea, really, of what to expect here; just something that \"looked cool\" in one of the brochures we got at the welcome center. Well, whatever we expected, that&apos;s not what it was... I&apos;m not sure how to describe this. Between the years 1907 and 1932 a retired Civil War veteran, Samuel P. Dinsmoor, built himself a \"stone log cabin\" and surrounded it with concrete sculptures. He created this as a source of income in his retirement. There is a series of sculptures with biblical motives and another series with socialist motives.

[20120913-134322] It shows works by various Kansas artists who aren&apos;t artists by training but started doing this because they felt they had to. One creates displays (like the Model \"T\" Ford below) chiseled from solid rock. One creates art works from soda can lids. One created a collage from all kinds of artifacts that people had dropped into a lake in California and were found when the lake was dredged. The center also has examples of the local use of sandstone for building in the back yard, and much, much more.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120913-132911] [20120913-131858] [20120913-131914] [20120913-130947] [20120913-132328] [20120913-132500] [20120913-132547]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;But wait, there&apos;s more! When the town of Lucas found it needd a public toilet, it worked with various artists to create one.

This was a fort on the western frontier, mainly to protect against Indians.

Tiny, but it had three cardio machines, a weight lifting contraption and some free weights. I biked and worked with free weights, did squats and used the weight machine. Not quite as long or as intensively as I should, probably, but better than nothing. After that we showered and had breakfast. Scrambled egg and a sausage biscuit, plus coffee that we bring up to the proper intensity by adding some instant coffee to it. Maybe itâ€™s just me, but the farther west we get, the weaker the coffee seems to be. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After weâ€™d packed up all our stuff again we drove off to Monument Rocks, which was on Ericâ€™s list. I wasnâ€™t so sure about it, especially when the Google maps directions he had printed back home would have had us turn into some dirt path to get there. We both agreed that that was probably not a good idea and drove on to see if we might come across a sign pointing to it. That really bothers me about Kansas: theyâ€™re awfully stingy with signage. But we found it, by following a dirt road. Not quite as rutted and cratered as the first one, but still. I wonder how people drive on these roads after a really heavy rain. [20120914-100747] [20120914-100948]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Monument Rocks, however, was absolutely worth the drive. Whatever made the Grand Canyon must have used Monument Rocks as a sampler! It also reminded me a little of the Badlands, but that may have been because of the weather. When we were at the Badlands in 1998, it was also very bright and the light played a really unusual trick. Well, I think itâ€™s unusual because I donâ€™t recall it ever happened to me again. The sun light somehow combined with the light-colored rock face so that the washed-out jeans cut-offs the boys were wearing that had scarcely any indigo left in them suddenly appeared to be quite dark blue. Strange, but true. That didnâ€™t happen here, but Monument Rocks is a very impressive rock formation. Along the side of the road, some of the dirt had washed away in a gully that looked exactly like a miniature of the Colorado River bed. Eric took pictures galore, of course, and by the time he was done, he was about covered in mud, but the pictures are worth it. [20120914-101807] [20120914-102208] [20120914-102228] [20120914-102521] [20120914-103436] [20120914-104135] [20120914-104333] [20120914-104602] [20120914-104712] [20120914-104729] [20120914-104820] [20120914-104930] [20120914-105507] [20120914-104333] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Monument Rocks we drove back to I-70 and onto Colby, where we visited the Prairie Museum. Colby is a little town that was first settled in the late 1870s by a J.R. and Mary Colby. Most of its collection, however, comes from the the Kuska family, who have lived in Colby for 50 years. They must have crammed their house to the rafters with all kinds of stuff, some of it junk, but some of it also very interesting. What was also interesting was that the museum also has exhibits outside, such as a sod cabin. Early settlers in Kansas often used sod to build shelter for their families, because lumber was either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. This particular soddy did have a timber roof, a wood floor, what Laura Ingalls Wilders would no doubt call â€œboughtenâ€ windows and white-washed walls, but probably not every settler could afford to do that. Some could not even afford tar paper for the roof of their soddy, so that whenever they had a heavy rain, the ceiling would drip for two or three days afterwards!

To be quite honest, we were a bit disappointed. For one thing, the reproduction seems quite small, but that may be because weâ€™ve become accustomed to the wide open spaces of Kansas in recent days. For another, they placed the easel in the wrong spot! When you look at it, you see the ugly yellow and red sign of a Dollar General store, a Napa auto parts store and a Pizza Hut before you see Van Goghâ€™s sunflowers. Even if itâ€™s just a reproduction, it deserves better than that, surely! I donâ€™t know why they didnâ€™t put it a little further west, so it could be sitting in some field by itself and have that much more impact. A question Iâ€™d like to find an answer to some day: How do they keep the colors from deteriorating if the thing is out there in all kinds of weather and exposed to prairie sun and wind day in and day out? [20120914-140706] [20120914-140943] [20120914-141146] [20120914-131821] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We drove off from Goodland to cover the last 20 miles of Kansas, only to find that the last stretch of I-70 west was being worked on and traffic was diverted onto the northern lane of I-70 east, which caused us to miss the â€œWelcome to Colorful Coloradoâ€ sign. That was clearly unacceptable, so Eric drove onto the shoulder, backed the car up to where it said â€œroad closedâ€ and I walked the last hundred yards or so to the sign, much to the dismay of the some of the road work crew who drove up to me to tell me that we really shouldn&apos;t do that. I just told them that Iâ€™d be very careful and that Iâ€™d be out of their hair just as soon as I could. I guess they gave up on me... [20120914-133438] [20120914-134149] [20120914-134207]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Unlike Kansas, Colorado has welcome centers galore, so we stopped at the first one, 11 miles from the Kansas-Colorado line. A very nice welcome center lady gave us so much information that itâ€™s probably going to take us at least an hour to sift through all of it and decide exactly where we want to go. For now, however, we were going to go to Lamar, in southeastern Colorado, to take a picture of the last Madonna of the Trail for this trip. From the welcome center to Lamar was a good 100 miles, and with the change in time zones from central to  mountain, we thought that would be quite enough for one day. [20120914-165823]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;However, just outside Lamar we came across the Amache internment camp for Japanese-Americans in World War II. Not much of the camp - which bears a disconcerting resemblance to a concentration camp, except that the inmates werenâ€™t being murdered - remains today, but some children of people who were interred there began to get together in the late 1970s to remember and to preserve as much of the site as they could. One of the signs said that of the 110,000 Japanese-Americans, two-thirds of whom were citizens, who were interred during World War II, not one has ever been convicted of espionage. Some Japanese-Americans of military age even volunteered for service in the armed forces and many served with distinction. When we came to Lamar, we found out that most governors exhibited the NIMBY-reflex when it came to establishing internment camps in their states, only governor Ralph L. Carr (1887-1950) took a principled stand, which cost him his political career. â€œOne of the few voices of reason during wartime was <a href=Ëhttp://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/govs/carr.htmlË> Governor Carr</a>, who continued to treat the Japanese-Americans with respect and sought to help them keep their American citizenship. He sacrificed his political career to bravely confront the often dark side of human nature. â€˜If you harm them, you must harm me. I was brought up in a small town where I knew the shame and dishonor of race hatred. I grew to despise it because it threatened the happiness of you and you and you.â€™â€ There is a statue to governor Carr in Sakura Square in Denver, according to an information panel at the Lamar welcome center. Weâ€™ll be sure to look him up!

Itâ€™s not very far when you look at the map, but nearly 30 miles were over unpaved Colorado state route 67, which took a long time. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We began by driving toward the Rockies via U.S. 50. We followed the driving tour of the Santa Fe Trail until the trail route went down toward New Mexico, while we continued westward. It was clear we were already at a higher elevation than we had been in recent days, because it was quite chilly in the morning. So chilly, in fact, that I got up to close the roomâ€™s window (we prefer to sleep with the window open if at all possible) and put the comforter back on the bed. It didnâ€™t really warm up until about 10 oâ€™clock, either. At first it didnâ€™t seem as if we were getting any closer to the Rockies, but after the city of Pueblo, we found ourselves surrounded by mountains all of a sudden. [20120915-090726] [20120915-093106a] [20120915-104733] [20120915-104929] [20120915-110023] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Pueblo we saw signs for the Royal Gorge bridge, and we thought that that might make an interesting side trip. Of course, the very fact that we continued to see sign after sign should have given us a clue that it was a tourist trap, but letâ€™s blame that on the difference in altitude. We drove all the way up there, only to find that itâ€™s some kind of bridge theme park, with all kinds of rides and no doubt crappy souvenirs by the bushel, for which they charged an entry fee of $26. Per person. We looked at each other and we immediately decided that while walking over the bridge might be a great experience (and would probably give gorgeous pictures), it wasnâ€™t likely to be $52 worth of great. So we turned around and drove back down the mountain. The whole area around the Royal Gorge bridge is one big tourist attraction, just like Ocean City or Hilton Head. Iâ€™m sure if you came here in the summer youâ€™d have to drive up the mountain in one long line of cars, like the Capital Beltway during rush hour. [20120915-112425] [20120915-114446] [20120915-114640] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I wanted to visit the Cripple Creek mining area and since state route 67 promised to be the scenic route there, we decided to take it. Luckily it was Ericâ€™s turn to drive. I donâ€™t really enjoy driving on gravel roads where you constantly feel the car sliding out from under you, even if you do keep it under control. State route 67 certainly lived up to its scenic route appellation. It was gorgeous! Itâ€™s owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the road is part of the Gold Belt Tour. A sign at one of the rest stops explained that miners used this road to transport gold out of Cripple Creek and supplies into it, until corporate mine-owners decided to build a narrow-gauge railroad. Unfortunately, narrow-gauge  rail cars tends to be rather unstable, so the cars tended to overturn easily. The railway only operated from 1894 until 1912, when a flash flood washed out the entire system. The tracks were dismantled in 1915. [20120915-124132] [20120915-124149] [20120915-131140] [20120915-125302] [20120915-132409] [20120915-134310] [20120915-140402] [20120915-141225] [20120915-142143] [20120915-143145] [20120915-145348]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The whole area around Pikes Peak was the scene of a gold rush, although not all deposits were discovered at the same time. Gold was discovered at Pikes Peak in 1859, but not until 1890 at Cripple Creek. However, Cripple Creek and Victor (the neighboring town) remain active gold mining areas to this day. The first thing you notice as you drive into Victor is that it looks almost like a shanty town with a view of mountaintop removal mining and huge slag heaps that are by now as tall as the mountains themselves, except that they are barren. Not a tree grows on them. A sign at a scenic overlook just outside Victor told us that â€œDirectly across the highway [state route 67] is the Cripple Creek and Victor Gold Mining Company. The largest gold mining company in Colorado, [...] Underground mining was conducted at this site for 70 years until 1961. Thereafter, all mining activity lapsed for a decade until the start-up of small-scale surface mining, using heapleaching methods. In 1991, surface mining was started on a large scale and continued to grow with the start of production from CC&amp;Vâ€™s Cresson Mine in 1995.â€ Apparently, weâ€™re all expected to applaud mountaintop removal. Perhaps the residents of Victor do. Except for the shanty town on the outskirts, their town look a tad shabby, but lived-in. Not so in Cripple Creek. That has become corporate Americaâ€™s vision of what a 19th century mining town should look like. At first you think the store fronts have been beautifully restored, but then you notice that itâ€™s casino upon casino, interspersed with bars and hotels and the like. I donâ€™t think anyone lives in this town. It all counts towards the emiseration of the proletariat. Thereâ€™s a reason unions sprang up in mining communities, people! As a matter of fact, the Western Federation of Miners was quite active in Cripple Creek. In 1894 they defeated a proposal by the mine owners to have the miners work 10 hours instead of eight for the same pay. The owners then offered 8 hours at a 16% reduction in pay, but that was also defeated. Unfortunately, a 1903 strike that resulted in casualties when some miners engaged in acts of terrorism ended up breaking the union, although elements were later subsumed into the Wobblies and later still the AFL-CIO.

I had found this place on the interwebz while we were preparing for this trip and it seemed to be less than perfectly unbiased, as indeed it turned out to be. One panel mentions strikes without specifying which strike theyâ€™re talking about, only to end with the triumphal announcement that the strike ended â€œand the union was broken.â€ Whoop-de-doo, I suppose. Unfortunately, most people know so little about history that this kind of bias will go unnoticed. I bet most people also never notice framed sign hung in an out-of-the-way corner of the centerâ€™s lower floor that reads: â€œGOLD. Proud of our environmental, health, and safety practices. Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mining Company - Anglogold Ashantiâ€ The latter is a South African gold mining outfit, in case youâ€™re curious. [20120915-153339] [20120915-155409] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We were pretty tired from the high altitude (Cripple Creekâ€™s elevation is 9,494 feet) so we thought it might be nice if we could stay in town. But there was no room for us at the inn, so we decided to drive on toward Colorado Springs. We ended up getting a room at the Woodland Park Country Lodge. It happens to have a nice pool and spa that we just used, which is why Iâ€™m posting so late.','2012-09-16 02:43:53','D','2012-09-16 02:43:53','N'),('20120917B0001','nicoline','20120916','Pikes Peak &amp; Air Force Academy','Today we went to Pikes Peak. To be honest, it wasnâ€™t high on my list of priorities. Weâ€™d tried to go there in 2007, but gave up when we realized weâ€™d be snaking up the mountain like rush hour traffic on the Capital beltway and I never thought it was a great loss. But I was wrong, and Iâ€™m glad we did take the time to drive all the way to the top and back. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In fact, I did all the driving so Eric could take pictures. Not that we didnâ€™t stop plenty of times to take even more pictures, of course. I usually just wait in the car while Eric fiddles about with apertures and shutter times and what not, but this time the views were so compelling that I just had to get out of the car and enjoy them myself. Itâ€™s only a 19 mile drive, but what with the fact that you rarely get about 20 mph and all the stops, it took us at least 90 minutes to get to the top. Amazingly, we overtook several dozen bicyclists. I do admire their dedication, but I wonder if theyâ€™ll be able to walk at all tomorrow. Also, it must be pretty dangerous to bike down again!

After the first four miles or so a park ranger makes you stop for a mandatory brake check. The brakes were a tad on the hot side, even though Iâ€™m sure I rarely got above walking speed, mostly driving in first or second gear. Anyway, on the rangerâ€™s advice I drove down most of the rest of Pikes Peak in first gear and we made it down safely. Yay for our reliable Honda Accord!

Another item not high on my list - sorry, Fred :-) - but Iâ€™m glad we went. The display in the visitorsâ€™ center was informative, though I had to google Barry Goldwater to figure out why it is named for the senator from Arizona. As it turns out, Goldwater served in the Army Air Forces (the Air Force did not become a separate branch of service until 1947) and flew missions in South America, Africa and Asia, including going over â€œthe humpâ€ to fly supplies to Nationalist China over the Himalayas. After the war he remained a reservist, retiring as a major general and having flown 165 (!) different types of aircraft. All this according to Wikipedia.

After the visitorsâ€™ center we walked up the chapel trail. The chapel is... something else. Youâ€™d never know it was a chapel if you didnâ€™t go inside. I wonder why they chose to give it 17 spires. Most religions go for numbers like 3, 7, 10 or 12. Itâ€™s clear that the protestant variety of Christianity dominates, with Catholics, Jews and Buddhists relegated to basement. Muslims donâ€™t get any room to worship at all, and thatâ€™s not likely to chance any time soon, given the latest furore. Of all the denominations, Buddhists were the only ones to make a point of saying that everyone is welcome. The floor of the synagogue is made out of stones that came from Jerusalem and that were donated by the Israel Defense Force.

Late yesterday afternoon we both noticed that the car made the sort of noise youâ€™d expect it to make when you drive over a rough patch of asphalt, even when the asphalt was as smooth as glass (well, almost). The brakes worked just fine, but I had seen that the rear driverâ€™s side tire was wearing unevenly, so I thought the wheels might have been knocked out of alignment by driving over rough roads recently or that the shock(s) were giving out. As it turned out, that tire was about to blow. Eric took the car to a Meineke close to the hotel (yay for Google!) while I took the time to do two loads of laundry. Good thing we took the time to get it looked at, because you definitely donâ€™t want to drive over mountain roads with no guardrails to speak of when one of your tires blows up. The Meineke people immidiately sent Eric to a nearby tire place, with the warning that â€œItâ€™ll probably hold out while you drive over there.â€ The place was just a couple of miles away. [20120917-104954] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Having had both rear tires replaced - it doesnâ€™t do to replace just one, of course - we drove a little farther west on I-70 and then up Colorado state route 119 to a little town called Nederland. As I said on facebook the other day, the people who named the town Nederland do not have a proper understanding of the meaning of the word â€œNederland,â€ which means low-lying land. Sure, the town is at a significantly lower elevation than the nearby town of Caribou, but 8,236 feet hardly qualifies as low-lying!

One of the ladies at the local geodes, fossils, crystals and gemstone store actually spoke Dutch, too, because her mother happens to be Dutch. We mailed a ton of postcards with â€œGreeting from Nederland, Coloradoâ€ while we waited for the food to arrive at the Pioneer Inn, another funky place (which also happens to serve excellent food!) and where one of the patrons had the longest dreadlocks Iâ€™ve ever seen on anyone. Iâ€™m sure if he sat on a regular chair his dreads would sweep the ground, but as it happened, he sat on a bar stool. His hair hung down way below the seat but didnâ€™t touch the floor.

We are so lucky to be making our trip in September! I hadnâ€™t realized the trees start turning here much earlier than we are used to in Maryland, because of the higher elevation. We met a couple who were trying to take their picture with the fall colors in the background. Rebecca told me she was from upstate New York, so no stranger to beautiful fall colors, but she was blown away by the panorama as well. I offered to take the picture for them, which improved it slightly, but Eric had of course gotten out his camera - Zachary definitely expressed camera envy :-) - and tripod, so I asked them if theyâ€™d like their picture taken with a Nikon D300 and we could email the pics to them or they could get them off our blog. One thing led to another, and Zachary was able to give us a couple of tips for the rest of our trip. Weâ€™ll be sure to check out the sites you mentioned tonight; thanks!

Weâ€™re still adjusting to the altitude. Itâ€™s getting better, but itâ€™s probably better to err on the side of caution in these mountains.

Yesterday we felt a rumbling while driving up I-25 to Denver, so we felt we had to have it checked out. While Nicoline stayed back at the hotel to do laundry, I drove to a Meineke to ask them to check out the wheels and tires. The mechanic didn&apos;t have to look far to notice that the left rear tire had the thread separating. So I drove (carefully!) to a nearby tire shop and got two new rear tires installed. [20120917-104954]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;All of this meant we were off to a late start today, but around 11:30 we were on the road again. The goal today would be Estes Park, close to the entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park, which we plan to explore more tomorrow. We&apos;re planning to drive up through the Rockies, not in front of them, by taking Colorado state routes 119, 72 and 7.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We start out on I-70 driving into the mountains. [20120917-113656] I&apos;ve been to Denver twice before (once on a business trip, once on our 2007 around-the-US trip), looked at the mountains, and wondered how it would be to just into those mountains. Now I know. The Interstate starts out curving in front and then between some of the foothills, but before you know it you&apos;re really in the mountains.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120917-114626] [20120917-115618] [20120917-115903]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Just before Idaho Springs [20120917-121036] we turn right onto US-6 to take us to Colorado 119. Now we&apos;re really going through mountains, passing Black Hawk, which I guess is an Native American reservation since it is filled to the brim with casinos. We continue on driving not too far from the continental divide up the&lf;&nl;Rockies until we reach our lunch destination.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120917-122416] [20120917-123359] [20120917-124205]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We have lunch in a town called Nederland!  We noticed this town name on the map and of course had to make sure we&apos;d stop there! It turns out this town is named after a Dutch mining company that took over mining in the area, but now it seems to be a tourist stop for many Dutch tourists. We even ran into someone who speaks Dutch in one of the shops! [20120917-131253] We had lunch at the \"Pioneer Inn\" and took a ride n the \"Carousel of Happiness,\" featuring (according to its website) 56 whimsical, hand-carved animals on a restored 1910 Looff carousel.

In Estes Park, [20120917-161454] we had some trouble finding an affordable motel.

If you havenâ€™t visited it yet, you should! It is spectacular. We started with a hike, after getting hiking advice from a park ranger. After all, weâ€™re not used to hiking at these altitudes - the mountains over which the Appalachian Trail runs in Maryland are mere mosquito bites compared to the Rockies - and weâ€™re a tad out of shape into the bargain.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We settled on a couple of short hikes in the Bear Lake area of the park, for a total of 3.6 miles, going up 600 feet, which took us two and half hours. After that, we drove the Trail Ridge Highway (U.S. 34) through the northern end and down the western flank of the park. Iâ€™m not even going to attempt to describe the scenery; just look at the pictures.

Itâ€™s so high up that part of the road is closed from October to Memorial Day and road crews have to come in to clear snow banks that can be as tall as 35 feet before the road can be opened to the public. Because itâ€™s only accessible a few months of the year, building the road took six years, from 1926 to 1932. [20120918-135919] [20120918-140015] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;What with stopping every few miles, or so it seemed, switchbacks, and hardly ever going more than 30 mph, it took us three hours to complete the entire route, but that certainly wasnâ€™t the end of mountain driving for today. After an hour or so on U.S. 40 we hit the Berthoud Pass, again crossing over the continental divide. The switchbacks here were even more challenging than those on the Trail Ridge Highway! We were glad to find a motel, even if itâ€™s a bit on the seedy side, with a hot tub. We spent half an hour blissfully soaking in the hot bubbles and then headed back to our room and to bed with a dinner of rice crackers with cheese and an apple.

[20120918-080441] We started out at the visitor center, asking the ranger there for suggestions. The ranger suggested to drive up to Beaver Lake and hike to Dream Lake. It turns out that there is construction in the park, and cars are only allowed to enter on that stretch between 8:00 and 9:00. Fortunately, we had gotten up early: we were at the visitor center at 8:04 and were in the park on the road by 8:20.

At Beaver Lake, we started our hike and it was beautiful there. The first part, to Nymph Lake, was mostly between trees. [20120918-090934] The path is asphalt but still going up nicely. The lake is pretty small and has a lot of water plants in it.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120918-114021] [20120918-091109] [20120918-092507] [20120918-092750]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The second part of the hike, to Dream Lake, was mostly a gravel path.

It also looked gorgeous with the mountains in the background! At this point, there were two ways we could go: either to Lake Haiyaha or to Emerald Lake. Lake Haiyaha was twice as long and twice as much a climb, so we decided on Emerald Lake: the combination of altitude and us not being in the greatest condition anymore was starting to make itself noticed.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120918-100603] [20120918-095748] [20120918-100824] [20120918-101137]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On the way to Emerald Lake we passed by a chipmunk kind enough to pose for us.

We arrived in Moab, Utah, around 7 p.m., thinking weâ€™d drive up to the first reasonably priced motel we saw and book a room. Uh, no. It seems all the world comes to Moab in September, because itâ€™s much too hot here in the summer. The place is booked solid! After enquiring at just about every motel or hotel in town, we finally found a cabin at a local hostel. Not quite what we had in mind, but itâ€™s OK. Someone is singing and playing the guitar as Iâ€™m writing this, people next to me are having a civilized discussion about politics, and someone else is watching Mythbusters on a tv in the corner.

There arenâ€™t cities to speak of. As we drove in, we wondered why we didnâ€™t see any houses or even any cattle near the road, as weâ€™ve seen in every other state we drove through. We were a little low on gas, or we would have taken one of the exits to check out the â€œtownsâ€ they point to, while also making clear that thereâ€™s nothing much there: no services from the Colorado line to just past the first Utah welcome center, 40 miles or so into the state. The lady at the welcome center explained that this is because these towns don&apos;t really exist anymore, they&apos;re just names. Most of the land over which I-70 runs is owned by the Bureau of Land Management. [20120919-172457] [20120919-172523] [20120919-175106] [20120919-175920] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Good thing we gorged ourselves on a pint of Ben &amp; Jerryâ€™s ice cream in Grand Junction, CO. We actually meant to find an ice cream store, but when that didnâ€™t pan out, we were like â€œTo heck with it, weâ€™ll just buy some at a supermarket and eat it right then and there!â€ Which is exactly what we did. We have all our stuff with us, after all, so Eric got out the camp chairs and I dug up the spoons and we ate a pint of ice cream each. Eric had Vanilla Heath Bar Crunch and I tried Key Lime Pie. To be honest, it could have been a bit more lime-ish, but it was good all the same.

Lunch consisted of 3 rice crackers with cheese and a banana each, plus as much water as we could hold, because weâ€™d just completed a hike of only 1.2 miles each way, but what it lacked in length it made up in height: it rose 1,020 feet!  We went into it thinking that if it got to be too much, weâ€™d just turn around and go down, but a family with two little kids - one a baby in a carrier and the other a three-year-old - started at about the same time we did, but overtook us seemingly effortlessly. After seeing that we had to complete the hike, no matter how strenuous! Having seen so many beautiful sights the last two weeks, we thought we were a bit jaded, but the goal of the hike, the hanging lake and waterfall were among the most gorgeous things Iâ€™ve seen so far.

After a breakfast of wheat puffs and instant coffee - which I served Eric in bed because of his sweet status update yesterday -  we drove 30 miles or so from Idaho Springs, CO, to the Eisenhower Tunnel. Zachary had warned us Monday not to swerve off the road once we cleared the tunnel, and he was absolutely right. It was spectacular, and it only got more spectacular the farther west we drove. The more we see of this country, the more amazed we are! When youâ€™re in a national park, you expect to see beautiful vistas and things, but you donâ€™t really need to go into a park.

I had been reading about it, and definitely wanted to do some hiking there (the Hanging Lake trail sounded interesting) but somehow I though it was somewhere beyond Grand Junction.

We just about averaged the record speed of a whole one mile per hour... we took it easy (after all, we&apos;re still a couple of thousand feet up in the mountains), moving slowly and taking plenty of breaks, but did make it.

We wanted to get up to Delicate Arch, which is supposed to be best either at sunrise or sunset, but we couldnâ€™t bring ourselves to get up quite that early.

Eric originally wanted to explore other areas first, but I put my foot down and said that I wasnâ€™t planning to hike over a pile of rocks in the middle of the day when the park already warns you to take at least a quart of water per person, use sunblock, and wear protective sun gear. I certainly was glad I had recently bought a sun hat at LL Bean. It was a bit expensive (seeing as we own at least a dozen baseball caps and a straw hat - itâ€™s falling apart, so I only use it when gardening) but itâ€™s supposed to be SPF30 and the brim goes most all the way around my head, so the tops of my ears are covered, too. &lf;&nl;[20120920-082710] [20120920-083340] [20120920-085525] [20120920-090233] [20120920-090542] [20120920-090645] [20120920-093354] [20120920-093629] [20120920-093737] [20120920-093944] [20120920-094411] [20120920-094645] [20120920-094946] [20120920-095128] [20120920-095735] [20120920-102020] [20120920-102151] [20120920-102225] [20120920-102423] [20120920-102426] [20120920-103051] [20120920-103203] [20120920-103358] [20120920-103742] [20120920-104058] [20120920-105000] [20120920-105151] [20120920-105241] [20120920-105559] [20120920-110632] [20120920-110652] [20120920-112647] [20120920-112840] [20120920-113113] [20120920-113259] [20120920-114002] [20120920-114200] [20120920-114237] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The hike was moderately strenuous, but the views over Delicate Arch and the surrounding country were worth it! It is such a very peculiar, starkly beautiful landscape. Thereâ€™s a cabin at the trailhead, left there by a pioneering family who staked a claim there in the late 1800s. The patriarch, a Civil War veteran from Ohio, and his oldest son came there first, and later on his daughter, her husband and their two children joined them. The sign near the cabin said that the daughter was so appalled by the primitive conditions that she managed to convince her father to build a better cabin. We looked in the cabin: it canâ€™t have been more than 10 by 10 feet on the inside, with six (!) people apparently sharing it. Also, if that is supposed to be the â€œluxuryâ€ cabin, I hate to think under what circumstances the father and son lived there at first! In the end, they couldnâ€™t make a go of it and returned to Ohio by first decade of the 20th century. Iâ€™m not surprised they couldnâ€™t. They wanted to start a cattle ranch, and I suppose you could let your cattle graze in the canyons if thereâ€™s a river and thereâ€™s sufficient rain. But I donâ€™t quite see how you could possibly have a garden there, so youâ€™d have to bring imperishable foods, like beans and rice, or maybe canned stuff. Not a very varied diet. Much as I appreciate solitude, I think Iâ€™d go stark raving mad if I had to live there! When I told Eric so, he said youâ€™d probably have to be stark raving mad to want to homestead there in the first place. He had certainly had a point there.

The odd thing is that in its current condition, itâ€™s only a little bit older than Frank. On September 1, 1991 a sizable portion of the arch broke off, to make the opening far wider and thinner on top than it was before. Some lucky hiker managed to get a picture of it, which is displayed on the information sign. You used to be able to hike underneath it, but because of the danger of the arch caving in completely or bits falling off again, the park has closed that part of the trail. As it is, the hike to Landscape Arch is billed as one of the shorter, easy ones at only 0.8 miles (one way), but what they donâ€™t tell you is that about a quarter of that is through dry, soft sand and another quarter is over smooth rock with the thinnest layer of sand, which makes it about as slippery as ice. No fair! But we made it back, and as it was about 2 p.m. we were about finished with hiking for the day.

But itâ€™s apparently been like that for years, so it must be more stable than it looks. Then we went back to the visitorsâ€™ center to refill our water containers. Remembering the dry, hot climate from our 2007 trip, we brought a collapsible 5-gallon water container and we also have several water bottles, among them a souvenir one that I bought at Pikes Peak. When itâ€™s full, it can stand by itself like any bottle, but when itâ€™s empty, you can roll it up almost flat, because itâ€™s a plastic bag with a drinking spout. I thought itâ€™d come in handy on Appalachian Trail hikes or otherwise. I guess the otherwise came first in this case. While Eric took care of the water supply, I bought the last postcards Iâ€™m going to send from this trip. I had stamps, so I could write and mail them right then and there.

Since she was a local, we took her word for it, and lo and behold: we found a motel room at the first try. The place even had a pool and a hot tub, which was a nice treat for our poor, mistreated leg muscles.

[20120920-082710] This was, after all, the reason we spent the night in the sold-out town of Moab... After a good night&apos;s sleep, we had breakfast at a pancake place Nicoline had seen yesterday. For most of the trip, the hotels and motels included breakfast (this seems to be pretty much standard nowadays; usually just a bar with coffee, juices, danishes and such, but sometimes much more elaborate) but of course the hostel didn&apos;t provide that. They did offer the use of a kitchen, but we weren&apos;t really looking forward to putting a lot of effort into our breakfast. Anyway, after breakfast we went to the park. The first stop was at the visitor center, where they had faucets with filtered water to fill up your water bottles (our bottles were already full). &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120920-074616] [20120920-082932] [20120920-083340] [20120920-085054]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;And then we went into the park. [20120920-090233] We did stop at the first few viewpoints, but then decided to move on the <em>Delicate Arch Trail,</em> the 3-mile round-trip trail we decided would be our main hike for the day. It did have a 480 feet elevation change, so although a little bit longer it wasn&apos;t as bad as yesterday&apos;s hike  but still a reasonably tough walk. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20120920-090533] [20120920-091120] [20120920-090645]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The trail started out relatively easy as a nice gravel path but it got more challenging later on: [20120920-095516] rock, sand, sliprock... Most of the path was marked by cairns (piles of rocks). And we had some great views along the way.

Weâ€™d rinsed out and hung up our bathing suits after last nightâ€™s hot tub session and this morning they were completely dry. Usually, my stuff takes at least 2 days to dry completely, because it has more layers. Farmers out here apparently donâ€™t even bother to let the hay dry before they bale it. I saw bales as green as grass sitting in fields and on tractor trailers. It would seem to me that that could be dangerous. Iâ€™ve always heard that too much moisture in hay bales (or grass bales, in this case) can make the temperature inside a stack reach dangerously high levels, leading to spontaneous hay fires. But maybe Utah farmers donâ€™t have to worry about that, with the air being so dry. [20120921-085803] [20120921-090002] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Today was a day for driving instead of hiking. After we left Monticello, we headed south for 20 miles or so to Bluff, Utah, on U.S. 191 and then took Utah state route 95 west. Our Utah highway map marked it as scenic and they were not kidding! What also stood out was that, unless there was another car on the road, it was completely quiet out here. You might hear a bee buzzing by or maybe a rustle of wind, but otherwise absolutely no sound at all. I must be more of city person than I realized, because I found the silence downright creepy at times. It must be that Iâ€™m used to always hearing at least some sound so I only notice its absence.

He particularly wanted to check those out, so we did. The first one was only about a mile and a half down a dirt road, so that was no big deal, but the second one involved driving down a dirt road for 11 miles to get to the rim of the Dirty Devil River canyon. I told Eric that heâ€™d have to drive back to state route 95 and proper asphalt, because it did get a bit hairy here and there. Sometimes I drove up a slight rise without having any clue as to which way the road would turn, for example, or there wouldnâ€™t be any road at all, just soft sand, and Iâ€™d be terrified the car would get stuck in it.

So we activated plan B, which involved looking for a motel in the nearest town, Hanksville, that looked on the map as though it might boast a motel. In fact, it had two, but neither had any vacancies. So much for plan B. The next plan involved driving another 140 miles to Salina, Utah. That way weâ€™d be back on I-70 and within reasonable distance of Cove Fort. At least that plan worked out, so here we are, 55 miles away from our goal.

Then we drove to exit 1, where we visited historic Cove Fort. Thereâ€™s nothing else there, no town, nor even a gas station.

It also served as a relay point for the pony express and as a rest stop for the stage coach that passed through twice a day. Hinkley was the paternal grandfather of Gordon B. Hinkley (1910-2008), who first assumed a leadership position the Mormon church in 1958 and at the time of his death was president of the LDS. At that time, Native American tribes in the region, the Ute, Paiute, Apache and Navajo, sought to stem the flood of white settlers that threatened to overwhelm them and their traditional way of life. The various altercations have become known as the Black Hawk War (1865-1872). Fearing hostilities from Native American tribes, Brigham Young ordered that the way station be constructed as a fort, but it was never actually used as such.  [20120922-100455] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As Cove Fort was built with basalt and lime stone, it has stood the test of time very well. By the 1890s, as Utah was in the process of becoming a state (1896), the fort was no longer needed and the LDS leased it out at first and later sold it. The Hinckley family bought it back in 1989 and also had Ira Hinckleyâ€™s cabin brought over from Coalville, Utah, northeast of Salt Lake City. Itâ€™s now a museum that provides free tours given by LDS members. There is a small Mormon settlement right next to the fort, because the LDS apparently makes people go there for a year or up to 18 months and provides them with housing. I suppose theyâ€™re all in some way needed to run the fort. They cultivate a large vegetable and flower garden and that supplies much of their food. The produce they donâ€™t eat they donate to a local food bank, according to our tour guide.

Force of habit, I suppose. From now on, weâ€™re going to be heading east! The first thing we did on our way east was to stop in Richfield, Utah, to get our car serviced. It has served us so faithfully these last few weeks that we thought an extra oil change would be in order. We also had the air filter replaced, because it was filthy after these dusty back roads weâ€™ve been driving on. In case you&apos;re ever in western Utah and you need your car taken care of, check out the Goodyear place in Richfield!

It sounds awful, I know, but weâ€™ve seen so much and visited so many interesting places that we just didnâ€™t need any more of that. Salina is actually the site of the first engagement in the Black Hawk War and there is supposedly a statue of an Indian chief in town, but we didnâ€™t see it after we drove back here from Richfield. Its other claim to fame (or infamy, perhaps) is a July 7, 1945 <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/ci_3256256?rss\">massacre</a> of nine German prisoners of war who had not yet been repatriated and were encamped near Salina to help with the harvest. The victims of the massacre are buried at a military cemetary in Salt Lake City. I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s any kind of memorial in Salina, but the one history museum we found was closed. The sign outside said that it was a Presbyterian church built in 1884 as a memorial for some lady from New York City. I suppose the Presbyterians were anxious to provide some sort of counterweight to the Mormons, but I donâ€™t quite see why a New York City lady should have a memorial way out west in what was then still Utah Territory. [20120922-134214] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The town itself doesnâ€™t seem to be a very exciting place and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised at all if none of the locals knew anything about the Presbyterian church, the massacre, or the Black Hawk War. When we had dinner in Monticello, Utah, the other day, we asked the server if she knew what the MD in the restaurantâ€™s name stood for. She said she got that question a lot, but she had never bothered to find out what the answer was. She thought it might just be someoneâ€™s cattle brand. [20120922-152941]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We had planned to celebrate todayâ€™s achievement with a restaurant dinner, but thereâ€™s nothing here except a Dennyâ€™s and a couple of grubby-looking local places.

To be quite honest, it was a little disappointing. The interpretive center, which forms the introduction to the Mark Twain boyhood home and a couple of other sites that feature in â€œTom Sawyerâ€ and â€œHuckleberry Finnâ€ tries hard to make things interesting, but mostly succeeds at adding Mark Twain quotes to a very traditional type of display. The town itself badly needs a makeover, or at least an alternate route into the historic district. The way it is now, you pass a decrepit-looking trailer park, some storage facilities, houses that could do with a lick of paint and a warehouse that, despite its broken-down look actually seems to house some welding company or other.

We saw it too late to get a picture of it, but I assure you it was right there. Certainly the Paul Simon Freeway (I-55), named for the U.S. senator, not the singer, looked nicer. Just after the Effingham, Ill. cross we finally caught the rainstorm that had been threatening all day. Not much fun to drive in, but at least it washed some of the dust off the car. Indiana, for some reason, doesnâ€™t think it should put up a â€œWelcome to Indianaâ€ sign in the place where youâ€™d expect it, which is more or less on the state line, so we didnâ€™t get to snap a picture of it.

Together with my wife Nicoline I will be traveling the length of I-70, starting at the eastern end in Baltimore and going all the way to the western end in Cove Fort, Utah.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To be honest, one of the reasons I created this website is just because I can&amp;mdash;I am an Internet programmer by profession and maintaining my personal website is one of my hobbies. But I also created this site because we found during our 2007 two-month trip around the U.S. that it is fun to stay in touch with friends and family during a long trip. And more importantly we found in the five years since that the diary of a trip is a wonderful electronic keepsake, one that we keep coming back to years later.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Another of my hobbies is photography which is why this website is also geared towards maintaining a photographic record of the trip. This means that I&apos;m planning to spend an hour or more every evening downloading photos from the camera to the laptop, sorting through, labeling and (if necessary) processing them, and finally posting the best ones on the website.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I sincerely hope that those of you reading this will have as much fun as we intend to have on the trip!','','2012-09-01 20:56:55','D','N'),('nicoline','Nicoline Smits','32fa765aab3745bf2b24488bdcca6bc0','nicolinesmits@gmail.com','maint','cmamV','','yes','2012-04-15 13:28:19','A','N'),('mark','Mark Grivel','25de472c591d0d715b375dd88e05350b','markgrivel@gmail.com','visitor','osEbd',NULL,'yes','2012-04-15 13:36:52','B','N'),('uncledonna','Donna Camp','eb49194cccc646fc8e93a368301834ea','mccamp@comcast.net','visitor','HBCtz',NULL,'yes','2012-04-15 21:40:42','B','N'),('rashida','Rashida Bess','052db1d1b856f38bb9fe2906452268da','rahim_1_love@yahoo.com','temp','HwVXf',NULL,'yes','2012-04-15 16:18:14','B','N'),('katiekhadem','Katie Khadem','2fd15e4b2bbe8877ee89ba60b1c3784f','katie.khadem@gmail.com','visitor','BFJmk','','yes','2012-04-22 20:14:57','A','N'),('kandace','Kandace York','d9e7dcbc599298f390d1b2ae68506015','fieldstone@luckey.net','visitor','sjcrh',NULL,'yes','2012-05-19 22:41:24','B','N'),('splendajoy','Brenda Butler','5c3661bef3435ef3594f0532ba67eea1','brenda.j.butler@ssa.gov','visitor','Bs4c',NULL,'yes','2012-08-31 17:31:28','B','N'),('slmyers','Sheree Myers','0b0063948a15cef1ac544589eaaca456','shereemyers8111@gmail.com','temp','8dNoG',NULL,'yes','2012-09-01 16:42:29','B','N'),('frank','Frank Grivel','fad35f0edc1aa54bb4d0b4e759147a8b','frank.grivel@gmail.com','visitor','okvew',NULL,'yes','2012-09-03 13:22:09','B','N'),('efrish','Ellen','03ac4e2dcb2cc25cebb862e5900b39dd','elfrishberg@gmail.com','visitor','VRojJ',NULL,'yes','2012-09-10 02:58:10','B','N'),('rmsloving','rose slade','d0761ff5e72704ea1009d5db64fd8d08','rmsloving@aol.com','visitor','VTp7z',NULL,'no','2012-09-19 14:56:42','B','N'),('mkutrik','Matt Kutrik','e6d52b73077bc8564bbe80bace7a74c4','Matthew.J.Kutrik@ssa.gov','visitor','vi5Yv',NULL,'no','2012-09-27 21:12:49','B','N');

The driver of a stagecoach generally had to concentrate on controlling the horses and following the trail. Security was usually handled by a second man seated next to the driver, who often wielded a shotgun for protection. This shotgun position did offer a few privileges, so passengers on stagecoaches without a designated shotgun rider would often ask the driver for permission to ride in the \"shotgun\" seat.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The modern practice of calling shotgun has little to do with security, but everything to do with comfort. Calling shotgun successfully usually means having some influence over the audio system and climate control, although the driver may have the ultimate power of veto. The shotgun rider may also have to assume the role of navigator, as well as become a second pair of eyes when looking for landmarks or interstate exits.\" (http://www.wisegeek.com/in-a-car-what-does-calling-shotgun-mean.htm)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;','2007-06-26 16:09:57','B','2007-06-26 16:09:57','N'),(73,'B73','diary','200706230003','shanran','','Mark,&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;\"Officers fly back and forth over a pre-determined section of highway.

Yes, we do get tired for driving after a while, which is partly why we had a \"rest day\" yesterday (July 4th). At some point you just *don&apos;t* want to spend a whole day in the car. But you have to realize that driving in the U.S. is not comparable to driving in Holland. It&apos;s a huge country with enormous distances; people are used to driving far. Driving is much less stressful than in Europe. In Holland, driving from Delft to Enkhuizen (something like 100, 120 kilometers) is tiresome; driving 200 miles here (300 kilometers) is a breeze. Of course, it helps that both my wife and I enjoy driving.

Maybe during your trip you will get lucky enough to see something I have experienced twice while traveling across the country. One happened on I-70 in the Kansas Plains. It was one of those long straight stretches of road that goes on for miles ... I was driving in the westbound traffic lanes, in sunlight. Meanwhile, the eastbound traffic lanes were darkened and partly obscured by a fairly torrential downpour. The drivers there had to use their headlights while traffic moving west did not. ... things remained exactly like that for twelve miles, then, finally, the storm either shifted northward, or the highway took one of those almost unnoticeable shifts to the South and I too was in the storm. While it lasted, it was a very interesting and unique experience. Save for a few stray drops, the Westbound lanes had remained completely dry, while the eastbound were drenched.  &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;-- Ray --','2007-07-09 04:45:41','B','2007-07-09 04:45:41','N'),(141,'B141','comment','B138','ray1031','','Anita ...

When water is absorbed , the outer pulp of the Saguaro can expand like an accordion, increasing the diameter of the stem and, in this way, can increase its weight by up to a ton.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Saguaro often begins life in the shelter of a \"nurse\" tree or shrub which can provide a shaded, moister habitat for the germination of life. The Saguaro grows very slowly -- perhaps an inch a year -- but to a great height, 15 to 50 feet. The largest plants, with more than 5 arms, are estimated to be 200 years old. An average old Saguaro would have 5 arms and be about 30 feet tall.\"','2007-07-09 12:28:32','B','2007-07-09 12:28:32','N'),(147,'B147','diary','200707080001','marijke','','Dag allevier,&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Blijf me verbazen over de prachtige foto&apos;s en wat is het toch een enorm land.

This established the then center in Kansas. When Alaska and Hawaii were added the center was recomputed using the Southwestern most tip of Hawaii and the Northwestern most tip of Alaska. By using \"These\" specific points, they were not including most of the Aleutian Islands. I believe they used a point some miles west of Barrow (but the memory is foggy here). As for Hawaii being About forty degrees \"west\" of Hawaii - it is also over 20 degrees \"south\" of California. So as you move the \"line\" West - you also move it south. It would still be further West, were it not for Alaska. The degree \"difference\" figures for Alaska are almost the reverse of those for Hawaii ... Hawaii approx +50 west, +24 South of the old point in California ... Alaska is approx +30 west and +45 north of it&apos;s old NE point in Washington State.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In some few ways they cancel one another ... while it did move the Geographic Center of the country, it moved just under 5 degrees of longitude \"west\", and just over 5 degrees of Latitude \"north\". &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It&apos;s probably even more confusing \"after\" the explanation - as I remember it.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Ray','2007-08-02 05:01:01','B','2007-08-02 05:01:01','N'),(250,'C272','photo','20070801-153432','frank','','Puffy Pants!!!','2007-08-02 18:22:53','C','2007-08-02 18:22:53','N'),(251,'C273','diary','200707310002','frank','','The water was plenty warm.','2007-08-02 18:48:14','C','2007-08-02 18:48:14','N'),(252,'C274','comment','C272','mark','','=D','2007-08-02 19:08:06','C','2007-08-02 19:08:06','N'),(253,'C276','photo','20070801-153432','mark','','Ha, we must be close to Canada! \"Keep off yellow, A! =P','2007-08-03 14:08:54','C','2007-08-03 14:08:54','N'),(254,'C277','photo','20070801-144345','mark','','AHHHH!

Tensions begin to rise as we wait for mom. Who knows what she&apos;s doing. Finally, mom comes to the door and dad tells her something, I don&apos;t know what. We pile in and the journey starts.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I try to get some shut-eye at the start of the trip. Not going to happen, but worth a try. I tell mom and dad, \"Wake me up just before sunrise. I want to see it.\" They say okay and we continue heading down the streets. Just before our first rest stop is the Virgina Welcome Center on I-66, Frank wakes me up, I had been sleeping! \"The sun is starting to rise.\" He said. We come to the visitor center and have a bagel. I just woke up, so naturally, food was welcome. We change places, Instead of: Me in the back, Frank in the middle, Dad driving, and Mom shotgun; It becomes: Me back, Mom middle, Dad driving and Frank shotgun. We barrel down the highway as Mom and I have a conversation. It was a meaningless one, just a time-filler.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We start heading down the road again. I don&apos;t notice a difference in space, but Frank does. Shotgun has more room then the center isle, who would have thought? We continue driving until about an hour later, we come to another rest stop. I-81.&lf;&nl;[20070623-064037] [20070623-064046]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The seats change again. Well, not for me, but the rest of us. I&apos;m in the back, Frank in the center, Mom driving and Dad shotgun. Frank says he&apos;s happy that he has more leg room now. Frank and I start watching Beverly Hills Cop II and we are peacefully enjoying it when yet again, another rest stop. We get out to get gas and Frank and I start cleaning the windows with the sponge things they have. Not like they&apos;re clean, we probably just made them dirtier... Nevertheless, we keep at it until all the windows are clean. Dad, Frank, and I walk to the picnic table at the other end of the gas station. I notice it was dirty, so I went and explored up the steep hill until I came to a platform. Nobody eats there, so it was VERY clean. Comparatively of course, I wouldn&apos;t have eaten off it. We have a snack and we pile back into the small, small, small mini-van. This time I moved. Mom had back,, to try and get some shut-eye, Frank had middle again, Dad was driving and I had shotgun. Ah, the leg room!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We start off again, and I begin typing this story. I notice a sign that states: \"Speed laws enforced by aircraft.\" AIRCRAFT?! Can somebody please explain how this works?! Does a plane have a megaphone, yell at the person that is speeding and say, \"PULL OVER, PULL OVER! Thank you, now please wait while I land this plane at the nearest airport. Can  I trust you to stay there while I drive back in a police cruiser? Thanks so much! I&apos;ll be back in an hour and a half or so! Cya then!\" Somehow I doubt the integrity of some people. I bet that 95% of the people pulled over like that would just drive off... Meh, whatever...

One, a big green and yellow thing, sat almost on her shoulder, next to the headrest. A smaller white one sat on top of its cage in the passenger seat, and the smallest one, which was also white, I think, was climbing its way up the interior, which was torn in places. Eric got a picture of her, too. [20070623-075656]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Another weird sight was a water tower somewhere in Georgia done up as a giant peach.

I had wanted to attend services at Ebenezer Baptist Church, but I didn&apos;t bring any remotely dressy clothes and I didn&apos;t want to offend worshippers by walking in in shorts and t-shirt. But the house was fun to see, and even though the exhibit at the visitors&apos; center did not tell us anything we didn&apos;t know, it is strange to think that only about 40 or 50 years ago, we would have seen \"whites only\" signs all over the South. It reminds you that, while \"Gone with the Wind\" is a great novel, the period it is set in isn&apos;t one we ought to be nostalgic for. Nevertheless, we came to see the GWTW sights, so after some searching (really, highway signage in Georgia needs work!) we managed to find a visitors&apos; center, but it was closed.

Frank came back from taking a shower and told me that the Game Warden was here. The Game Warden was supposed to take the dog to the pound. I took the liberty to take the dog by his leash I made and walked him up. He left immediately.

That really is a bit too much just to see the history of Coca Cola. Those kind of prices are OK if you&apos;re just on a short trip, but with an eight-week trip like ours, we just have to think very carefully about spending that kind of money on attractions.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After this we left Atlanta for the International Airport, which Frank really wanted to see.

[20070626-082409] The water was gorgeous!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After packing everything up, we drive towards Clarksdale. [20070626-112832] Again, we are struck by how green Mississippi is. Also, it comes across as a very friendly place. Somehow, the area we are driving through seems very well off; lots of expensive houses.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;This changes when we come to Clarksdale, where the downtown is really run down. We visit the Delta Blues Museum [20070626-123440] to learn more about the roots of the Blues music.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After visiting the museum, we get some carry-out at a Quiznos and eat in a laundromat, while doing our laundry. [20070626-144229] In there, I also take the opportunity to do some cataloging of photos. It looks as if there&apos;s even WiFi available in the laundromat (probably leeching over from a nearby business) but I don&apos;t try to connect.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Clarksdale, we continue south on SR-1 towards Greenville. Along the road there, we come across a big patch of cacti, some of which are flowering.

We started out on U.S. 61 and drove to Grand Gulf State Park because it had been recommended for its view of the Mississippi. It didn&apos;t disappoint: [20070627-103543]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From there we drove on to Natchez, which is a very pretty little town. According to the the Triple A tourbook, it was once home to Maj. Andrew Ellicott, who apparently did survey work there, as he did in what was to become Washington, D.C. I&apos;ll look into this when I get home. [20070627-121652][20070627-123311]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We wanted to see at least one antebellum mansion, and we decided to visit Rosemont Plantation, the boyhood home of Jefferson Davis. As it is not a national historic site but still privately owned (although the Jefferson mansion is no longer lived in), the tour information was a just a tad biased towards the southern point of view, but whatever. It&apos;s a beautiful house, with a lot of period furnishings. [20070627-140151] [20070627-141229]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To the relieve of the boys, we finally went on to New Orleans after visiting Rosemont. The drive there was uneventful and to be honest a little tedious. We chose to travel via Mississippi state route 24 to I-55, so as to avoid rush hour traffic around Baton Rouge. Besides, Frank had requested that we drive into New Orleans over the Lake Ponchartrain Causeway. This 20+ mile bridge spans Lake Ponchartrain and it is quite an experience to drive over such a large body of water. It puts the Bay Bridge to shame. [20070627-173026] Frank rode shotgun, and he got some really pretty pictures of the sun and clouds over the water. [20070627-173720] [20070627-173705]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After some searching (Mark riding shotgun and map reading) we found our hotel, which is right on the edge of the French Quarter. Getting the car into the parking garage was an adventure in itself, with Frank walking next to it to make sure cargo bag on the roof wouldn&apos;t hit the ceiling. It only just fit in some spots! After we got all our stuff out of the car and into the room (except for the stuff in the rooftop carrier, which we stuffed in the back seat), we went out on to Bourbon Street. I now understand why NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu says that New Orleans is the only place in the south where you can get away from the Baptists. Really, as beautiful as the states that we&apos;ve driven through so far are, you can&apos;t go a mile and a half before running into a Baptist church or some equally conservative other brand of religion. Whoever thought up the strategy of convincing the faithful that God really wanted a Republican in the White House was an excellent political strategist (but a lousy statesman). Let&apos;s hope God has tired of Republicans as thoroughly as the rest of the country! Bourbon Street probably qualifies quite easily as the most sinful street in America, but they&apos;re quite open and honest about it. Bourbon Street is one big frat party, but the rest of the French Quarter is charmingly old world, with people sitting outside cafes on sidewalks, pedestrians everywhere. The only thing I have against New Orleans is that it is so hot, and that will only be worse tomorrow, when we intend to walk to the different sights we want to see.&lf;&nl;[20070627-213934]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;','2007-07-28 20:06:40','C','2007-06-28 22:25:31','N'),('200706280001','nicoline','20070628','New Orleans','Well, we walked alright. We walked to the French Market just off Jackson Square for breakfast and had coffee and beignets. [20070628-093351] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then we walked a little further along Magazine Street, to the National Park New Orleans Jazz Park. The program we were most interested in didn&apos;t start until 3 p.m. so on the advice of the park ranger, we walked back along the waterfront to a ferry across the Mississippi. [20070628-100246] [20070628-103846] [20070628-104433] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;A local advised us to walk along the embankment on the Algiers side of the city to where the Mardi Gras floats are built. [20070628-110911] [20070628-111000] [20070628-112036] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So we did that, and then got back on the ferry and walked through the River Front mall to the Convention Center to go to the National World War II museum. All this, mind you, in 95 degree heat and I don&apos;t even want to know what kind of humidity. According to yet another local, it&apos;s not even exceptionally hot for New Orleans yet. That will come in August and September, he said. I thought heat and humidity were bad on the East Coast, but this beats everything! How people ever lived here before airconditioning and wearing the sort of clothes they did is beyond me. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we saw the World War II museum, which was interesting, but a little disjointed in my humble opinion. They should have more general information about the war instead of concentrating so much on individual campaigns. If you don&apos;t have a pretty thorough knowledge of the war in general, I think you&apos;re lost by the time you visit the Midway exhibit, however interesting the veterans&apos; individual stories are. But that&apos;s just me. [20070628-131529] The reason, by the way, that the World War II museum is located in New Orleans is that that&apos;s where the landing craft that were used in all major World War II campaigns, including D-Day, were built. [20070628-140349]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the museum we walked back on Magazine to the National Park service station, where we attended the ranger program. Two park rangers provided almost an hour of information, including music and singing, on the influence of Creole music on New Orleans jazz and how it traveled down the Mississippi out into the Caribbean. We learned that the expression \"Hey, la bas!\" is the  \"Whassup?!\" of the French-speaking Caribbean. The French they speak, however, is quite different from the little French I remember from high school and also delivered in such a rapid-fire way that I can&apos;t do much more than pick up a word here or there. [20070628-151541] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Afterwards, we walked back yet again to let Mark buy a souvenir t-shirt and to get back to the hotel. I think we must have walked at least 4 or 5 miles today! All the same, we get the kids some pizza and soda and go out again for \"diner a deux\" and walk down a few blocks from our hotel to the House of Blues on Decatur Street and afterwards to Jackson Square to watch the people go by, which is an attraction in itself in New Orleans.','2007-06-29 22:50:11','C','2007-06-28 22:31:54','N'),('200706230007','eric','20070623','','Some more photos of today:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070623-130930] [20070623-132947] [20070623-134151] [20070623-184737]','2007-06-29 03:24:59','C','2007-06-29 03:24:24','N'),('200706270002','eric','20070627','Mississippi to New Orleans','Today is the second day we intended to spend experiencing Mississippi. We ended up in Vicksburg yesterday, but it was overcast and even raining at the end of the day by the time we got to the Mississippi, so I never got any good photos of the river. One of the things I wanted to achieve today was get a really good picture of it. The first try was at Vicksburg itself, at the Tourist Information center. [20070627-093727]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At the tourist information, we learned that there is no road that comes close to the Mississippi, but one place where you can get close is at the Civil War park at Grand Gulf. We stopped there and I took a series of seven photos that could come together to form a single panoramic image:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070627-103604] [20070627-103601] [20070627-103559] [20070627-103549] [20070627-103543] [20070627-103540] [20070627-103537]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Mississippi is a river with a will of its own, and before the Army Corps of Engineers started \"taming\" it, it often changed it course. Still, the river will sometimes flood. Here is Mark with a flood marker at the Grand Gulf site, showing how much higher the river has come in the past. [20070627-104505]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I commented before how green the state of Mississippi is. This picture, [20070627-105442] taken on our way back from the Grand Gulf site to the highway, gives some feeling of the greenness we found here.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The next stop was Natchez, because it is known for its old mansions, one of which is the House on Ellicott Hills [20070627-121652] which, we think, may be named after one of the Ellicott brothers who founded Ellicott City (where we live in Maryland).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In addition to looking at the old mansions, we had our first DVD with a backup of photos to mail home. [20070627-122200]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Natchez, being a river town, also boasts a view of the Mississippi. This is where I get my last picture of the Mississippi before we get to New Orleans. [20070627-125113]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Natchez, we stop at the Rosemont Plantation in Woodville. We expected something of a tourist trap, but actually there was nobody else there when we came. We got a private tour by the caretaker, which was nice. She once more confirmed our impression of Mississippi being a very friendly state. One of the cool things she showed us was a chandelier of oil lamps, with above each oil lamp a porcelain smoke catcher. This to prevent the soot from staining the ceiling. [20070627-140505]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Rosewood, we cut through to the I-55 and from there into Louisiana. As I was driving, I thought about the goodbye party for Mike Gallagher at work. Mike is going to enjoy his retirement in South Carolina; driving through the South as we have been doing the last few days, that idea starts to be more and more attractive. Mike, if you read this: I&apos;ll wish you well in your retirement!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Frank specifically asked to take the causeway across Lake Pontchatrain, so that we did. It looked as if there was no end in sight! [20070627-172307]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We did some searching to get to the hotel, but finally made it. After unpacking, we started our exploration on Bourbon Street. [20070627-194426] Talk about a tourist trap... but of course it is part of New Orleans.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Most places on Bourbon Street sell food, drinks, T-shirts, or girls. There are a few different ones, like this House of Voodoo. [20070627-195358]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We had dinner in a restaurant where they had lamps made out of musical instruments, like this trumpet lamp. [20070627-205445] After dinner, we went back to the hotel. Frank and Mark went to the hotel swimming pool (on the tenth floor, if you believe it), while Nicoline and I went back out.

Instead, we get dressed and go down to the French Market.

The one thing I can&apos;t help wondering is, how did (and possibly still do) people manage to live in those houses without central air? Specially the top floor must be getting awfully hot in summer.

[20070629-091344]  New Orleans cemeteries are special because nobody is buried under ground here.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Once we get to the I-10 west, we stay on it for a while. We make a brief stop at the Tiger Truck Stop [20070629-110304] where they have a real tiger; it looks kind of sorry, hanging around in a cage at a truck stop. It made Mark so angry that he wrote a draft of a letter to the humane society  to protest this.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We continue on I-10, coming through marshes, swamps and other watery areas. For lunch we turn off to Eunice, where we visit the Cajun Music Hall of Fame and Museum. [20070629-130000] It is a small museum dedicated to Cajun music. [20070629-124544] One of the displays was a cabinet showing the steps in making a violin; the original owner was a musician as well as violin maker. [20070629-124324] This museum drove the difference between \"Creole\" and \"Cajun\" home to me; the former being the mix of a whole lot of cultures, heavily influenced by African and West Indies cultures, whereas the latter is mostly based on Western European French. [20070629-124556] The Creole language was almost completely incomprehensible (although I could see some of the French influence), whereas I could actually read the Cajun signs in the museum.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We have lunch in Eunice in a place called \"Nick&apos;s on Second\" [20070629-131951] and then continue back to the I-10. We&apos;re getting some more rain (it seems to be raining every afternoon when we&apos;re traveling). [20070629-150534] Traffic is backed up repeatedly so it is slow going into Texas. When we get to the welcome center, [20070629-160741] we stop to ask if there is any problem with the flooding we&apos;ve heard about in the news, but they tell us we don&apos;t have to be concerned about that.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We continue on the I-10, congestion and all, until Winnie where we take the SR-124 south. Here we encounter our first Texas oil pumps. [20070629-175434]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Continuing along the Bolivar Peninsula, we are driving almost on the beach. At a random point, we stop, hike through a little bit of dunes (not even 100 yards) to get to the Gulf Coast beach. Here we take the opportunity to do some swimming -- the water is positively <em>warm</em>. Pelicans keep flying over while we swim here. &lf;&nl;[20070629-175823] [20070629-182259] [20070629-183332] [20070629-185516]&lf;&nl;[20070629-182224] [20070629-180054] [20070629-183538] [20070629-183555]&lf;&nl;[20070629-184642] [20070629-184647] [20070629-184833] [20070629-184841]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We have dinner in an Italian restaurant on the island.

[20070629-201918] Once in Galveston itself, we continue driving up the I-45 to Houston, taking its beltway, then back on the I-10 West.

I got some really nice pictures of the sky over said lake there:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070627-173720] [20070627-173705]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I especially liked the Bourbon street... that was really fun. If you walk past a certain point after around 6ish in the PM, the people on the balconies throw Mardi Gras beads at you. [20070627-194426] I got 2 green beads :). Lots of drunk people there... There were some very interesting shirts on display there, one of which my brother bought. It says, \"I got bourbon faced on shit street.\" Some other interesting ones include, \"F**k milk, got pot?\" (Without the stars, of course), and \"I&apos;ve got the body of a God -- Buddah.\" Things like that, and \"Big Ass Beers\", along with \"Hand Grenades\" (the type of glass the beer is served in...) etc. makes bourbon street - indeed, New Orleans in general worth a visit. The hotel was nice too, but the swimming pool smelled really funky.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The next morning, we got up, and went to the Caf&amp;eacute; du Monde for breakfast, a 20 minute walk from the hotel. It was already plenty warm by the time we got there. We had French beignets (loaded with tons of powdered sugar, which my dad saw fit to eat with a spoon... pure sugar... the crazy) [20070628-093351].&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After that, we headed to the ferry to take it over to Algiers (?) or something to that effect. We quickly popped our heads into the World of Mardi Gras workshop type thing. We headed back, and went to the Riverwalk (mall) where Mark and I ate pizza (however, not after he had a SNAFU with the number of slices to be ordered...)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Thereafter we went to the WWII/D-Day museum and walked around there before walking for 45 minutes to the Park Ranger creole music thingy... By the way, the WWII museum there was really worth the visit, a lot of knowledgeable people (a WWII vet whose life had been saved by the famed Higgins landing craft was there, my brother and I learned a lot about the landing craft from him. For instance, did you know that the landing craft used in the movie Saving Private Ryan were really Korea and Vietnam-era landing craft, because the authentic WWII landing craft [20070628-131632] were scrapped after WWII.) Anyway, after that, we headed back to the hotel, ate more pizza, and went to sleep.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After we left New Orleans, yesterday (June 29th), we headed out to Texas, passing a quaint little Cajun Music museum in Eunice, where we stopped for lunch. We headed out, and when we reached Texas [20070629-160815], we stopped at the welcome center. Would you believe that they are still proud of supporting the idiot-in-chief?! I never knew such people still existed.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We drove down to Gilchrist, and swam in the Gulf for a little while (my dad lost my flip-flops which I so dearly loved :) ) [20070629-182259]. We ate dinner at a pizza place, where we had our first experience with real-live red necks (!!!). Their necks *are* really red. Anyway, when we left, my mom was bitching, to which my dad said, \"mom doesn&apos;t bitch\", to which my mom replied, indignantly, \"I do so bitch!\". It was funny...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We crossed from Port Bolivar to Galveston via a ferry, which was very interesting [20070629-201918] [20070629-202202] [20070629-201816], and we drove until around 10pm, when we pulled into a Super 8, and headed off to dream land.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Today, we&apos;ve driven around 300 miles as of writing, coming up to Johnson City now.

[20070629-122732] The Cajun Hall of Fame was kind of interesting. It&apos;s only a small place, but since none of us know much of Cajun music or culture, it was a great place to get started. [20070629-125531] Lunch was a little disappointing. We ate at \"Nick&apos;s\" on 2nd street (Deuxieme Rue; all street signs in Eunice are in French) because the lady at the museum had recommended it, but we felt like second class citizens. Some of the locals came in after us but got their food and their check before the waitress had even found time to take our drink order. Whatever...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Between Eunice and the Texas welcome center on I-10 we ran into some pretty heavy downpours. At times I couldn&apos;t go more than 30 mph. However, the advantage of rainstorms here seems to be that they are intense, but they don&apos;t last that long. After the welcome center, Eric took over driving and we took a little detour along the Gulf Coast. We even got to swim in the Gulf! [20070629-184647] [20070629-184841] It is so nice to go into warm seawater. That&apos;s something we miss out on on the East Coast (and the West Coast, too, I hear). We used to take beach vacations in Holland when I was a kid and I never liked going into the water there, either, it was always freezing. We drove along the Gulf coast almost from Port Arthur to Port Bolivar. We enjoyed a beautiful sunset and took a ferry to Galveston.[20070629-200502] [20070629-201816] From there we drove north until just west of Houston, which is a city like a christmas tree.

You feel very small and insignificant in a landscape as big as this. I can&apos;t help but wonder what it must have been like for earlier settlers. I mean, we travel in the comfort of an airconditioned car over paved roads with plenty of conveniences and have accurate maps and all that. Part of the mission of the Lewis and Clark expedition was to provide accurate maps of the area the U.S. had just purchased. Of course Texas wasn&apos;t part of that, but I doubt the Spanish had mapped their New World possessions very thoroughly. Even Lewis and Clark were instructed to look for the fabled Northwestern Passage! But to travel into an area on horseback or in a horse-drawn wagon, with only the most rudimentary of maps if any, without knowing what lies ahead of you, or if you&apos;re going to find food or water, making perhaps 30 or 40 miles a day when you have no idea how far the land stretches, doesn&apos;t just take undaunted courage but quiet determination as well. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, from Houston we drive to Johnson City in Texas Hill Country. We first visit the Lyndon B. Johnson National and State Park, where we take a tour of the Johnson Ranch, including the house that was called the Texas White House during his presidency. He loved this land, and it is easy to see why. It is beautiful! Just the skies are a source of amazement, it is never the same two minutes on end and it may be raining one minute and bright and sunny the next.

And boy, does he enjoy it. He feeds deer and camels and buffalo and ostriches and heaven only knows what other critters. Frank and I aren&apos;t so keen on animals and we especially dislike the male ostrich who thinks nothing of sticking his head into the trolley and grabbing the feed right out of the bucket. Mark also gets to spend a good half hour at the petting zoo, refreshing his goat-handling skills, before we head out to Pedernales State Park (the locals pronounce it Perdenales, by the way) where we have reserved a camping spot.

It&apos;s a shame, because it&apos;s a *beautiful* park and I would have liked to explore it further. The kids also wanted to go swimming but I don&apos;t let them, because the river has just flooded and is still kind of high, according tot he park ranger. He also had a story about a narrow escape one family had just a week or two ago. They had to be rescued from the river by helicopter and only just made it to safety. Besides, it is so humid that the wet towels and swimming trunks will never get dry before we have to pack everything up again. We all go to bed early because we want to leave for New Mexico early in the morning. Frank sleeps in the car, because his allergies are acting up. Also, it saves putting up and taking down a tent.

From left to right: the camping gear (sleeping bags, tents, mattresses, pillows) goes in the carrier on top. On the second row on the left side we have a 5 gallon water container, which we filled now that we get to more desert-like areas. Here we also store the laptop. In the back we have one crate with all our shoes (left) and one with miscellaneous stuff like medicines, toilet paper, etc. These crates usually stay in the car. Under the crates are two camping chairs; two more are on the sides. Then there is a second 5-gallon water container, the three duffel bags with our clothes and stuff, and the laundry bags. Towels on top to keep it all cool. Finally, we have a cooler bag full of water bottles which we drink from (look familiar, Shannon?) and refill every night. If possible we try to keep them cool.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070702-085049] [20070702-092818] [20070702-092915] [20070702-092024] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In addition, we have a cooler which we keep cool with ice with contains the perishables. There are two more crates on the back row: the bottom one with electronics (DVD writer to make backups, camera cleaning supplies, extension cord, and so on) which mostly stays in the car. On top of it we have the crate with food stuff, day-to-day plates, cups, etc. This one always comes with us into the hotel. Frank and Mark, when it&apos;s their turn to sit on the back row, make themselves comfortable there. [20070702-092804] [20070702-100619]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, at 9:30, when it&apos;s already 91 degrees, we&apos;re leaving for the next leg of our journey. We decided to skip on Los Alamos and instead use today and tomorrow to get to Holbrook in a more relaxed pattern. It should be a total of about 400 miles, so something like 200 each day.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We took a vote this morning whether to go through Roswell or more south (which would bring us past the White Sands National Monument. Not surprisingly, Frank and Mark both voted for Roswell, whereas Nicoline preferred the White Sands route. We could possibly do both, but that would go against the idea of taking it easy for a little bit. In the end, we decided to go with the Roswell path. I stayed out of the discussion, but I had a slight preference for the Roswell route as well -- not because of Roswell itself, but because that route would take us past the National Radio Astronomy Observatory VLA Telescope; it would be nice if we could stop there for a moment to get some nice pictures.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We first drive up to Roswell. We don&apos;t see any green aliens, but do come across an airfield that seems to be partial military and partial storage. I get a couple of pictures before we&apos;re chased away.

(For instance, it&apos;s July 3rd and we&apos;re just entering Arizona when I write this.)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Hondo to San Antonio the landscape becomes much more mountainous.

[20070702-150143]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From San Antonio we take just about 10 miles of interstate (I-25) to Socorro. Driving the interstate reminded me vividly why we&apos;ve been trying to avoid it. Suddenly we&apos;re inundated with billboards, signs for McDonald, and the majestic landscape is taking a backseat. Driving the US highways is much more fun and almost as fast. Anyway, it is a sign next to the I-25 that guides us to our hotel for the night. It has a pool and free breakfast, and doesn&apos;t cost too much. Frank and Mark of course run off to enjoy the pool.

Frank comes for a bit, then leaves. Dad and I go on and take a few pictures. We then head back and return to the camp. Dad and I go back to the nature trail, I wanted to show the outlook to him. It was very pretty, overlooking two waterfalls and a bunch of plants. It was dark by the time we got there, so Dad didn&apos;t see very much. Ah well. I had to lead him back though.

Unfortunately, we couldn&apos;t get any pictures of the armadillo, but take our word for it please. We continue heading out and we start driving. We drive for at least 400 miles before we get to Carlsbad, where the caves are. To get there in time to explore the caves, we must be there by 3:30. 4:30 is when we arrive.

We can take the tour! YAY! We go down into the cave, 80 stories under, and Dad takes pictures. At times, it was pitch dark. The only reason Dad&apos;s pictures show up is because of his tri-pod. He can let the shudder stay open for 1.5 seconds. I&apos;ll show you the pictures in another post. Be patience please... Thanks! ANYWAY, the caverns are PRETTY!!I mean, they are just AMAZING And when we left again, to bring Mom and Frank to the RV and Cabin park we rented, Dad and I drove back. We both REALLY wanted to see the bat flight. Did you know that Mexican Tailed Bats are the size of your thumb? And that they can eat their body weight EVERY night? And do? And that there are 300,000 bats in the cave. That&apos;s the weight of your thumb x 300,000 = the amount of bugs the bats eat A DAY! And you thought bats were bad... ANYWAY, we watched them all swirl out of the cave, and what a site it was! I have never head a crowd of 100 people be SO quiet, as to not disturb the bats. A few bats even flew straight over the crowd doing aerobatics.  One even flew over my head by about an inch, SO CLOSE! Sadly, to not disturb the bats, no electronics were allowed. Nor cameras. Not like good pictures could be taken anyway... But oh well! After the flight, we drove back to the RV park that we were staying at and had dinner. At 9:00 PM, 11:00PM eastern. I played a little bit with the camp cat, she was VERY sweet, and turned in. Sadly, I couldn&apos;t check my email before the night. I faded off to dreamland in the top bunk of the bunk bed, Frank asleep below me.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I roll out of bed at around 8:30. Well, not roll, that would hurt... I&apos;m lying awake on the top bunk of the bed and wonder how to get down without waking Frank up, who is sleeping below me. I get out and eat breakfast of two sandwiches. I go and brush my teeth and come back. Frank is up now and I see if he wants to come with me to the game room. He says yes and we head off. We do make a pit stop in the petting zoo first. ANYWAY, we continue to the game room, and I challenge Frank to a game of ping pong. SURPRISE! I pwned him (beat him). After that we play at the basketball hoop thing. The thing that stops the balls from going down after the persons credits are over is broken, so Frank lifts it up and we take turns making, and missing, shots. We have a game, well, not really a game. We each get 100 shots, and we see who gets the most. Frank gets: 27/100, I get, drum roll please, 49/100!!! I win by a staggering... Hm... Oh, screw it, you do the math... Wait! I got it! By a staggering 22 baskets! Yay me! Mom calls me and tells me that it&apos;s time to go. We pile into the car and drive. And keep driving... We stop in the middle of nowhere at a hotel with a POOL!!! Frank and I immediately wanted to jump in, and this time, WE COULD! We leap into the pool and swim around. We decide to go across the street to the Wal Mart to get some goggles, but they sucked... what ever, they were only one dollar...','2007-07-09 14:37:03','C','2007-07-02 19:47:27','N'),('200707010001','nicoline','20070701','Johnson City to Carlsbad','We left Pedernales Falls State Park rather later than we had planned, because the alarm didn&apos;t go off.

As we drive from Johnson City to Fredericksburg, TX, we pass stand after roadside stand of peaches. Peach icecream, peach preserves, peach salsa, peach pie, peach cobbler, peach anything and everything.

You gradually see it turn from fields and orchards and stands of deciduous trees to pines, grasses and cacti to scraggy, small pines and shrubs.

More luck than skill, since we get to set the clock back an hour by going from central to mountain time. Personally, I&apos;m not a big fan of caves. I always wonder if they&apos;re not going to cave in suddenly and even though the cavern chambers are of the humongous variety, they give me a closed-in feeling. But that&apos;s just me. What possesses people to begin exploring a cave is something I&apos;ll never understand. You couldn&apos;t pay me to! The caves are really quite beautiful, though.

It&apos;s hard to describe what it looks like. For miles and miles you see an arid landscape, with few if any trees, and then all of a sudden a farmer with access to a well (or wells, perhaps) has assiduously irrigated his fields and they are as bright green as any you see in Maryland. [20070702-100713]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Near Roswell, we happen upon what Frank tells us is a storage facility for disused airplanes. The airline companies store older jets there, and use them for spare parts. Eric starts to shoot a series of pictures, but pretty soon a security guard drives up who tells him it&apos;s a secure area, photography not allowed.

[20070702-114901] After we stop to buy some lunch at a gas station in Hondo, the landscape becomes absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. Of course, we are still essentially lowland dwellers, so anywhere mountainous is exiting in and of itself, but New Mexico is incredible. Again, pictures don&apos;t do it justice (especially the ones I shot from the car), but it gives you an idea of the treat we had today.

We drove through some towns that looked distinctly Western in our eyes. [20070701-092553]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On the other hand, there is also a clear German influence visible.

The Petrified Forest was an interesting experience. We got there at just about the hottest period of the day, but of course we insisted upon taking a hike - nothing major, only about two miles on paved trails - in the blazing mid-day sun. The park rangers have probably long since given up on dissuading silly Easterners from such undertakings, so they just told us to take water bottles and wear sunscreen.

The views are really amazing, and although the landscape seems barren and lifeless, there is plenty of plant and animal life. We saw any number of jackrabbits and a number of different birds, as well as all kinds of different bushes and grasses. There were signs that explained how Native Americans used them for their medicinal properties or to make baskets and shoes and of course for food.

We went swimming at mid-day to cool off, but the greatest cooling effect comes when you get out of the pool. There is a pretty stiff breeze pretty much all the time, so your wet skin develops goosebumps even in desert heat. By the way, can someone explain to me how they manage to keep the pool water so cold?

For a little while just before sunset we were afraid fireworks would get canceled because the wind picked up to such a degree that it became a dust storm. I&apos;m sure Arizonans didn&apos;t call it that, but it sure felt as if I was getting sandblasted and I could feel a thin layer of dust forming on the laptop keys and everything else that was outside. So we took all of our stuff inside and waited for it to blow over. Fortunately it did, and we watched the fireworks display that the town of Holbrook put on. OK, it&apos;s not the spectacle that we see at Antietam or in Columbia, but you have to see fireworks on the fourth, and we did.

The part of Arizona that we drove through today was amazing. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At first we seemed to drive through a big meadow, with cliffs in the distance. The fields were yellow-greenish, with some kind of low shrub that forms dark green splotches here and there. [20070705-084844] [20070705-090209]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then all of a sudden we were driving along what looked like the bottom of a canyon, with the cliff walls rising almost right next to the road. You could really see the layers of earth. Mostly red and white, but occasionally there are black and brown layers as well. Sometimes the cliff looked as though it had caved in just yesterday, or as if a giant had sliced it with a knife. Bright yellow cattle guards really stood out. Why they paint them such a bright yellow I don&apos;t know. Maybe on account of dust storms? [20070705-093856] [20070705-091057] [20070705-090146]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then the road turned and we drove along a meadow again, with grass in every conceivable color. Some of it along the road was so pale yellow that it seemed to give off light. There are also grasses that are a silvery green, and tufts of the brightest kelly green you&apos;ll ever see outside of a St. Patrick&apos;s Day parade. The background color, however, was mostly mustard-colored. The cliffs were again in the distance, and horses and cattle grazed right along the edge of the road. [20070705-101818] [20070705-101855] [20070705-110428] [20070705-111219] [20070705-111254] [20070705-111359] [20070705-121104]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Once we got past a town called Many Farms it seemed  as though we drove right through the Grand Canyon itself. Red cliffs rose on either side of use, and although they looked smooth from a distance, we saw them up close enough that we could tell they were textured. The most amazing thing to me was that people live in this amazing landscape. Do you suppose it is just as normal and uneventful for them to look out of their kitchen window and see those cliffs as it is for us to see our neighbor&apos;s house across the street? Some of the houses were of a type I&apos;d never seen before either, octagonal in shape. In some case they were used as houses, but in others they seemed to be just outbuildings. I hadn&apos;t known, either, that cliffs and rocks could come in so many amazing and beautiful shapes and sizes and colors. Really, I&apos;d have to be a poet to do it justice with words. [20070705-112355]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The amazing landscape continues right up until the Four Corners monument. I had expected it to be a real tourist trap, but it is actually pretty low key. It is owned and operated by the Navajo Nation and although there were some souvenir shops and things like that around it, which mostly sold pottery and silver jewelry, it was nothing like some towns I remember driving through in the Smokey Mountains, for example, or Niagara Falls. I bought a set of earrings in the shape of a galloping horse for one of my nieces. [20070705-123902] [20070705-122726] [20070705-124528]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The one thing I hated about the landscape is the way some idiots apparently use it as their private dumping grounds. The state of Arizona put up signs saying \"Littering highways unlawful\" but it doesn&apos;t seem to work. What these people could be thinking (if you want to grace it with that term) is beyond me. I mean, if you heave a soda can out the window on the Washington beltway, it&apos;s still litter, but at least you&apos;re not spoiling the landscape. But to through things out along U.S. 160? They ought to be shot! [20070705-121244] [20070705-121331]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Four Corners we drove on into Colorado, and the landscape remained as awesome as ever. At first it didn&apos;t look at all like I&apos;d imagined Colorado, with lots of spruce and steep mountains. That only came just before the town of Cortez. Cortez itself was just such a tourist trap kind of town with restaurant upon restaurant and tourist attraction upon tourist attraction, and after the \"solitude\" and stark beauty of the desert and the plateau we just traveled through, it was rather a jarring contrast.[20070705-152458]  [20070705-141939] [20070705-143138] [20070705-151341]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Mesa Verde more than made up for it, however. The visitor&apos;s center was 15 miles from the park entrance and we drove along a winding mountain road to get there. It worried Frank a bit, because in places there were no guard rails. Just to the north of Mesa Verde a thunderstorm was brewing, but it hadn&apos;t reached the mesa yet, so as we drove along, we saw panoramic views with one half of the sky dark and threatening and the other half bright and sunny. [20070705-151251] [20070705-152447] [20070705-153300] [20070705-153354] [20070705-154748] [20070705-154837]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When we got to the visitors center we signed up for a tour of the Cliff Palace. It is a what is thought to be a prehistoric place of ceremony of the Pueblo indians. They built it right into the cliff wall, using the available sandstone and making mortar whenever they had enough rain. On top of the mesa they grew corn and other crops, and to reach their fields, they climbed the canyon wall like squirrels. They used small crescent-shaped indentations to cling to these walls. I was thankful the park service saw fit to provide us with ladders, which was quite adventurous enough for me, as the thunderstorm had finally moved over to the mesa. We had found come across a hotel right on top of the mountain which offered reasonable rates and great views, so we decided to stay the night. We even got to see a coyote from the restaurant and an amazingly clear rainbow. L[20070705-203457] [ater on we saw deer grazing from our hotel room window.

[20070706-113021] [20070706-114928] The colors were astounding, too. At one point, the cliffs on one side of the road were red and on the opposite side they were grey.

[20070708-090132]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After all we&apos;d seen earlier this week, I was afraid seeing a canyon up close could only be a disappointment, but it was spectacular! This is the view from the start of our hike, the first thing you see as you walk toward the canyon. [20070708-092328] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The park is actually named for a Mormon settler who wanted to start his own ranch here in the early 20th century. People who already lived there told him he should go visit the canyon near his home. He did, and fell in love with it to such an extent that he decided to start a kind of inn right on the canyon rim. When the canyon became a national park in the 1920s, he had to move the inn to his ranch, which is where Ruby&apos;s Inn is today. [20070709-075916]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We chose to do a combination of two moderate hikes, the Navajo Loop and the Queen&apos;s Garden Trail, which took us all the way down to the bottom of the canyon. Part of the Navajo Loop was blocked by a rock slide. The Park Service is working on reopening it by the end of this year. So we had to cut the hike short, but only by a little. The trail was paved and was fairly easy to walk. With proper footwear, that is. The information flyer the Park Service gave us yesterday warned that the number one, two and three causes of injury in Bryce Canyon are wearing unsuitable types of shoes and people did not read the flyer, or perhaps they preferred being fashionable to being sure-footed. But then, they also specifically ask that you do not feed wildlife, yet the chipmunks were nearly tame and had to be nudged gently on their tiny little behinds to make them get out of the way. I&apos;m pretty sure that means they&apos;ve come to expect being fed by humans. The only complaint I have about the park is that there are entirely too many people, but unfortunately, that&apos;s what you get in National Parks during the summer. Hint, folks: try to do a trip like this in September. Sure, some seasonal stuff may be closed, but you would probably have good weather and you&apos;d definitely get away from the madding crowd.&lf;&nl;[20070708-092141] [20070708-092218] [20070708-092423] [20070708-092727] [20070708-094339] [20070708-094803] [20070708-094932] [20070708-095322] [20070708-095502] [20070708-102130] [20070708-104143] [20070708-104402] [20070708-105157] [20070708-105858] [20070708-112233]','2007-07-11 03:57:03','C','2007-07-11 03:34:46','N'),('200707090002','nicoline','20070709','Grand Canyon','Well, I hate to tell you so, but Theodore Roosevelt was wrong. He is quoted in the AAA tour guide as saying that the Grand Canyon is something every American should see at least once, or words to that effect. Perhaps it was because we had seen so many astounding natural monuments before. If you drove up to the Grand Canyon straight from I-40 or if you flew into Flagstaff and drove up from there, you probably would be awed. But I&apos;m afraid we had become rather jaded by seeing the Painted Desert, the Valley of the Gods, Goosenecks, and Bryce Canyon and we were not as overwhelmed by the Grand Canyon as we had expected to be. It also didn&apos;t help that the weather was a tad hazy, so we couldn&apos;t see across to the South Rim. One thing that worked out really well, though, is coming the North Rim instead of the South Rim. Unless you prefer your bread and circuses to enjoying nature and such quiet as can be found in July, the North Rim is definitely the way to go! Point Royal on the North Rim is also the only place in the Grand Canyon from which you can see the Colorado River.

The kids were not even allowed to watch us \"gamble.\" As soon as they stood still at the slot machine, a hostess told them to move on. They&apos;re allowed to walk through, but no more than that.

It was pretty high on Eric&apos;s list of must-sees, but not so much for me. However, it was very interesting.The scale model gives you an idea of the magnitude of the operation. [20070712-121011] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070712-113747] [20070712-114427] Now I understand why Las Vegas is lit up like there is no tomorrow. And to think that they didn&apos;t even build the dam for the express purpose of generating electricity! According to the tour guide, the main purpose of the dam was to control the flood cycles of the lower Colorado River and to provide enough water to facilitate agricultural development. The electricity is just a nice added bonus. They also generate all their own electricity, and filter their own water. Look at the tiny little generator they use for that, compared to the eight monster turbines lined up on the Nevada side. There are nine such turbines on the Arizona side, the tour guide told us. [20070712-115027] [20070712-114648]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The dam itself was at first knows as the Boulder Dam, because they had meant to construct it a little higher up the river, in Boulder Canyon. Another reason the present site of the Hoover dam was chosen is that the dam is now parallel to the geological fault lines that run through the area, rather than being perpendicular to it at the original site. In some cases, the materials necessary to complete the dam were so massive that it was easier to dismantle a whole factory and rebuild it in Boulder City than to transport the completed pieces, since many roads and bridges along the way would not withstand the weight. [20070712-113451] [20070712-120712] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070712-104112] The reason the town that sprung up to house the construction workers is called Boulder City is that it wouldn&apos;t have done in those days to call it Hoover City. It wasn&apos;t until after World War II, when memories of the Depression had faded a little, that President Truman and Congress decided to rename it for former President Hoover. Hoover was an engineer by training, and although he may have been a visionary in his support for the dam project, he knew nothing whatsoever about social engineering and thought the Great Depression should be left to run its course, as a kind of Margaret Thatcher avant la lettre. That&apos;s why \"Hooverville\" connotates a shantytown and a people sleeping rough under old newspapers were said to be sleeping under \"Hoover blankets.\" [20070712-123558] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After we came back from the Hoover Dam tour, it was really too hot to do anything. I believe the temperature went up to 107 Fahrenheit, which is about 43 Celsius. The kids went to swim, and we stayed in our room. The result was that we were well-rested when it was time for dinner, while the kids were exhausted. So we bought them pizza and soda and left them in the room, while we went to take another look at Las Vegas. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I especially wanted to see the Venetian hotel/casino/resort, since it was said to be a pretty faithful replica of the city of Venice. I&apos;ve never been there (argh, to think of the places in Europe I <i>should</i> have visited!) but I recently read \"In the Company of the Courtesan\" by Sarah Dunant - which I recommend wholeheartedly if you like historical fiction - and if I couldn&apos;t visit the real Venice, I could at least do the next best thing. One area was supposed to replicate the Grand Canal, and when you walk into it from the artificial light of the shopping mall, you really are fooled into thinking that you&apos;re outside for a second or two.

[20070712-190338] [20070712-190353] I wonder if the person who painted them asked the same question Michelangelo is said to have asked the Pope when the latter wanted frescos painted on the ceiling of St. Peter&apos;s Basilica :-)&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There was one store in the shopping area where they sold Venetian (Murano) glass.

[20070712-110237] But that impression changed when we got closer.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We took the tour inside the dam (had to go through metal detectors and everything, and had to eat our snacks because no food or drinks were allowed) where we got a real idea of the size.

[20070712-113451] Fifty-three feet diameter each feeder pipe has its own tunnel to one of the generators.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Next stop on the tour was the generator room.

[20070712-124028] Before going back to the car we treated ourselves to an ice cream.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Hoover dam we went back to the hotel room. I was really tired, so I lied down for a bit after copying over photos and rested while Nicoline was busy with the laundry. We intended to go into Vegas again in the evening (not in the hot afternoon sun) but we figured that Frank and Mark might not be all that interested. Given the choice, they&apos;d rather have pizza in the hotel room and then stay there, which was fine by Nicoline and me.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One of the first places we passed by was the Harley Davidson cafe, with a gigantic motor cycle sticking out the front. Unfortunately, the picture doesn&apos;t quite show how big it is. [20070712-182537]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We park at the Venetian hotel / casino, which is supposedly constructed to resemble a Venetian palace. [20070712-191234]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We start out by being amazed at their mall. They actually recreated an Italian atmosphere in-doors.

I guess that if you don&apos;t drink, don&apos;t gamble, and don&apos;t want to spend a fortune to see a show, you&apos;re not really part of the primary target audience.... It was funny to see, and it definitely was different from what I remember from 18 years ago, but one day was clearly enough.

I wanted to be up early, because today is the day I get to fly. I got out of bed, dressed, and got my things ready to go. My dad got my brother out of bed, as I went down to see when breakfast was served (6:00).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When my brother was up and ready, we started loading the car with everything. The big black thing on the roof, the bags... it took a few minutes. When we were done, we came inside and got breakfast. After breakfast, we made sure we had everything, and we left in the car. Now the fun part.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Las Vegas Maccarran International Airport was not 5 minutes from our hotel... possibly 2 minutes at most. In any case, my mother and I got out in front of the Alaska check in area, and went straight to a e-check in kiosk. My boarding pass was printed, and we walked over to the security area. It was taking too long, so my mother left before we got there. I was going solo.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Security was a breeze, not too long a wait, but I forgot to take off my shoes, so I took them off and went through without a hitch. As I boarded the monorail to take me to the D gates, I called my mother to tell her I came through security in one piece, and I was heading out to the gate.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At the D gates, I went upstairs to my boarding gate (D26) and since I still had an hour and a half left before I flew, I walked around and looked at the different aircraft parked around the concourse: mainly Alaska 737s and a Delta 767. I bought a water bottle for $1.99 (no tax) as I was waiting, and continued to walk around the terminal. As 8:45 rolled around for boarding time of Alaska 663, I got on the aircraft (737-800) and asked to see the cockpit. I was allowed in, and walked in on the first officer completing the route-entry. I asked a few questions about departure runway (25R), weather (light winds, 28 Celcius), etc, and turned a knob controlling range of the \"Moving Map\" (EFIS, I think, or EHSI, or some other E-acronym). I went back to my seat, and got buckled in at seat 17A.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We taxied out to the runway as the flight attendants were showing the safety demonstration. The captain apparently forgot about this, and ordered the flight attendants to their seats before they finished. They still managed to finish, though. We took off, and after a rather steep climb, settled into a step, and then climbed higher, up to FL380 (38,000ft).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Let me say that the 737 is the loudest aircraft I have ever been on. The takeoff noise, and cruise noise were close to deafening. My ears got used to it, but it took a while.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The coming down part was really fun. A bunch of people in the back were \"rapping\" and commenting about how the aircraft was pointed up while they were supposed to be going down (you leveled off, dumb@55es), and being generally loud and obnoxious all the way to the gate. They were yelling to the front of the aircraft, \"You ready, Lavrone?\", and stuff like that. Really annoying. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, there was a layer of cloud maybe 1000-2000ft think, about 1000 -2000ft off the ground which we descended through. No turbulence save a slight bump right on top of the cloud layer. Breaking out, we passed right over Boeing Field (BFO) where we could see the new 787 sitting on the tarmac below us (!!!), along with a Japan Airlines 777 being serviced or something of the like. Landing took a little bit (the captain told me we were constantly being vectored for another downwind, as ATC couldn&apos;t figure out whether they wanted us on left or right downwind, and we ended up being vectored out to Paine Field (PAE)), and, as later explained by the captain, we hit another (landing) aircrafts wake turbulence just before touchdown, causing a \"hard\" landing. It was fun, though. The first officer welcomed me back, and gave me a few cards describing the aircraft and some other older ones (DC3 era).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As we taxied in (for those of you who have an airport chart handy - 16C, M, B, A), we went around the N gates, and turned into D8. I deplaned and headed into the main concourse to get something to eat. I decided on Chinese (which was expensive - $12 for the cheapest meal. I had all of $14 with me, including the $10 from my dad. Do the math: $1.99+$12.00 = $13.99; $14.00-$13.99 = $0.01), and ate at the big glass window thing. It was very nice, and I noted how clean the airport was. After I ate lunch, I went to the C gates, to catch my connecting flight (Alaska 480) at gate C15. The flight ended up being delayed to a boarding time of 13:30, and a departure time of near 14:00. I got on, and got seated in seat 30F, in the MD-80 (probably -82 or -83), which is a DC-9-80, which is now a B717 (well, no, thats a MD-95, which is a DC-9-95, but anyway...). The flight attendant was very nice to me, she got to know my name and all.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By the way, I highly recommend Alaska Airlines for travel. I had a lot of leg room, nice service, and a lot of food :). &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We took off, and, even sitting in the back, the noise was less than the 737... go figure. As we were climbing, the flight attendants and I had a nice chat, because their jump seat was directly in line with my row. The back of the aircraft itself was very empty. It was me and 2 older people in the back 5 or 6 rows. Not too bad. We passed over sights the rest have yet to see, such as Mt. St. Helens, Crater Lake, etc. Very nice views from 36,000ft up.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We descended into Los Angeles, and the landing was smooth enough. The aircraft seemed to slow down rather fast, and we taxied along taxiways Y, E, and D10 to reach the gate (31B). My little brother called to tell me they saw my plane land (which they didn&apos;t) and were ready to pick me up.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I walked out of the concourse, and went to the curb where I was picked up by my parents. We left the airport, and I found out that they saw a 737 instead of a MD80 land, meaning they didn&apos;t see me land. Oh well...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We drove to the Pacific Ocean, and I stuck my finger in. I have touched the Pacific Ocean :) .

I&apos;ll live, though.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I called a hotel close to the Maccarran Airport, and the rooms were extremely cheap ($53.10 a night) for the Las Vegas area. We booked it, and it all turned out fine. We were sitting right under the approach path of the 19s at LAS, so we could see several aircraft landing. [20070711-163630]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Mark and I went to the pool, which wasn&apos;t too cold. We dove right in, and had ourselves a grand ole&apos; time.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the pool, the family went out to dinner (which we never did have...) and went out along the Las Vegas strip. That was something else. I didn&apos;t know what to expect, but it exceeded every expectation I had.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Since my brother and I can&apos;t (legally) do much in Las Vegas, our parents took pity and bought us tickets to get into the Stratotower, or whatever it&apos;s called.

Me being a teenager, I&apos;m trying my hardest to act dead so they&apos;ll leave me alone to sleep in a comfortable bed.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In any case, I&apos;m eventually coaxed out of my (warm, soft, etc.) bed, and put on my clothes to head out to breakfast. We get to the breakfast place, and I&apos;m not feeling all too hungry, so I grab a few yoghurts and an egg, plus a cup o&apos; coffee, and sit down to eat it.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When we get back to the room, I go off to check my email, and, while checking my facebook, learn that some kids in my grade whom I know were involved in a very serious car accident, and they are in critical (but stable) condition at various hospitals around Ellicott City. Before you start speculating, police say alcohol was NOT a factor. Some of the kids were Medi-vac&apos;d to Johns Hopkins trauma, and they all have some sort of broken bone - one has a punctured lung. Nice way to start the day, no?&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we head off to EATM, and after driving around for an hour, we find the zoo. It was a bit early so we wait around, listening to a birthday party type thing.

He also tells us examples about what has happened in the past week with some dumb kids. Scary stuff, man.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So, we go and set up the campsite, and my mother cooks pancakes. [20070714-202915] Mark and I get a fire going, despite the reluctance of my mom. We eat, and keep the fire going, clean up, put everything out of reach of the bears, and go to sleep.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The next day, we wake up, and we can&apos;t make coffee, because we can&apos;t get the water to boil. We eat bagels next to the fire pit which contains a single (MASSIVE) pine cone [20070715-113612], which a neighbor from a neighboring campsite brought to us. Mark and I go collect firewood for the night while our parents clean up. We manage to get a decent pile of wood and kindling.[20070715-073440]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After breakfast and wood-collection time, we head out into the physical forest, since, after all, thats what we came to the bloody place for. The first thing we do is go and see the General Sherman tree, which is really, really, really big. I&apos;ll let my mother cover this tree in depth, because, frankly, I don&apos;t really see the significance of a massive tree...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, after the big tree, we do a trail, the Congress trail, to be exact. The trees along this trail are pretty much all Sequoias, and are bunched together so that there are little \"groves\", which the park has named, \"the House\" [20070715-114556], and, \"the Senate\" [20070715-113946]. There is a single tree named, \"the President\". [20070715-113820] These trees are really huge. You&apos;d really be surprised. I knew that they were supposed to be big, of course, but the width really took me by surprise. These things can easily be 30ft (9m) in diameter.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After this trail, we decided to go to the Visitor Center [20070715-130909] or something or other, where there was another big tree. We were going to do a 2 mile, 1 hour walk, but after all we&apos;ve seen, we were too tired to do it, so we went back to the campground and held a siesta. I went into my tent and shut my eyes for an hour and a half. When I got up, my mother had made a fire, and we were going to eat s&apos;mores and hotdogs. After this fire went out, my brother made a fire on which we cooked the hotdogs. They didn&apos;t turn out too bad. [20070715-170748]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After we ate the hotdogs, I made a larger fire over which we were going to make s&apos;mores. After a bit of finessing, I got it going, and it went. It was huge... [20070715-174218] Mark made a burning man \"\" out of kindling, which actually looked cool and at the same time, dubious. [20070715-191455] [20070715-191504]. A deer came by rather very close to our campsite, and just sat there and ate for a while. [20070715-200648] [20070715-201001] The fire got very hot - we were able to light a completely wet stick on fire within seconds of putting it in the white-hot ashes. It was awesome. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We finished off our s&apos;mores, and went to bed. Later, there was apparently a bear across the street, because there was a scream of, \"ELISHA, THERE&apos;S A BEAR!!!\" It was horrible, because she continued like that for about 10 minutes, and I (probably, also nobody else) could sleep afterwards.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anywaaay, we woke up the next day, and decided to go into Fresno for breakfast, because we were to lazy to make it ourselves. :) We ate brunch at a Denny&apos;s and drove on to SFO/Oakland.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070716-133134] [20070716-133136]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Frank','2007-07-18 16:00:26','C','2007-07-16 19:17:29','N'),('200707130002','eric','20070713','Driving to Los Angeles','Today is the day that Frank is scheduled to fly from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, while we make the same trip over the road.

[20070713-092638] That stretch concludes our experience with the desert Southwest. From San Bernardino on, the scenery becomes much more green.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Something else I&apos;m noticing: the different ways in which the speed limit is interpreted in different states. Here in California, it seems that five or ten miles above the posted limit is the normal speed (much like at home). In many of the states we have come through, people adhered much more to the speed limit; in Texas I noticed that most locals drove noticeably <b>slower</b> than the posted maximum. Yet another item where states are more different than I expected.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We get to enjoy the famous LA freeways [20070713-154828] (with the continuous backups) but we have time so we don&apos;t have to worry. We actually have so much time that we take a detour through Beverly Hills. We drive on Sunset Boulevard, Rodeo Drive and see some of the mansions (no idea which ones, but who cares) were I guess some of the filmstars live.

Flying to Los Angeles would normally take about an hour or so, but Frank managed to look up a flight that took him first to to Seattle and back down again to Los Angeles. So I said goodbye and hurried back to the car. He was there more than two hours before his flight, so he would definitely be on time, and besides, he was eager to get beyond security, where you can usually get a much better look at the planes. He called me to let me know he had made it past security before we were out of Las Vegas. I hadn&apos;t asked him to do so, so I appreciated this bit of thoughtfulness. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070713-073230] [20070713-075933] I managed to fall asleep practically right away, so I missed our entry into California, dang! At first it was very much like the desert landscape we had seen in most of the southwest, but after we stopped for lunch in San Bernadino (or perhaps it was another town close to San Bernadino, it wasn&apos;t easy to tell) it became much more like the California I had imagined. [20070713-092015] [20070713-111141]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We also saw the weirdest street name I&apos;ve ever seen! I guess they wanted to make sure they&apos;d always be last on the list or something.

[20070713-091812] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Of course it turned out that we had covered the distance Las Vegas - Los Angeles so quickly that we had plenty of time before we were due at the airport. Mark wanted to see Beverly Hills, and especially the Beverly Hills police building, because he&apos;s been watching \"Beverly Hills Cop.\" We couldn&apos;t find it, but we did see plenty of other famous places. We also saw the Hollywood sign, but we couldn&apos;t get close enough to take a good picture of it.

For once, we decided to turn on the airport information channel, and a good thing we did, too! At Los Angeles International you are not supposed to park for even a minute, unless it&apos;s to let passengers in and out of the car. You&apos;re supposed to just keep circling and circling until your party is at the curb. You pick him/her up and drive off. You&apos;d think that in a city like Los Angeles they would have figured out a way to put in a cell phone waiting area, such as the one at Washington-Dulles, but no. Luckily, Frank&apos;s flight arrived on time and as he had no checked luggage, he&apos;s out pretty quickly.

Seen one freeway, seen &apos;em all, right? At Santa Monica, we decided to take some time to stop and actually see the ocean, which was a first for Mark and me. Eric had been to California several times before, and Frank had just flown up and down the Pacific coast. To my mind, the Pacific is a much more proper ocean than the Atlantic. For one thing, as we drove toward it, it appeared after you go over the top of a hill. Also, the sun sets in the sea, as opposed to over land. And it was cold! If there&apos;s anything I remember from beach vacations as a kid in Holland, it is that the water was always freezing cold!

It&apos;s scenic alright, but almost impossibly steep and winding.

Moorpark is actually a community college, but the program at EATM is so demanding that they recommend completing a bachelor&apos;s degree elsewhere first before coming to Moorpark. It was very interesting to see the different animals and see the students interact with them.

Of course we had underestimated the distance, so we ended up having to rush to get the tents set up and cooking dinner almost in the dark. When we arrived, the ranger gave us a whole spiel about bear activity in the area. There had been several bear incidents in the past few days, so you have to put absolutely everything into bear boxes. Not just food, but also anything that gives off a smell, such as soap and toothpaste and things like that. It was a little more than we had bargained for, but the bears were thoughtful enough to allow us a decent night&apos;s rest.

We had found a hotel last night in Simi Valley, near Moorpark, just north-west of Los Angeles because Moorpark College has the \"Exotic Animal Training and Management Program\" (EATM), which if I understand correctly is the only university-level education for learning to deal with animals. I&apos;m sure Mark can explain it much better but basically they have students with a bachelors degree who spend two years to learn about working with and training all kinds of animals. Graduates of EATM are picked up by zoos as well as movie studios around the world.

[20070714-113028] Personally, I think it might be pretty ambitious to get into EATM (they only accept a relatively few students each year, from all over the country), but I was also impressed with what the students do and I think that if Mark puts in the effort, it&apos;s going to be a good fit for him.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the visit to EATM we need to continue on since we have a camp place reserved in Sequoia National Park. And it&apos;s a good thing we reserved a spot; almost all campgrounds in the park are full. [20070714-175636]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The drive up to the park is impressive. We drive through plains for hours; it is so flat it almost looks like Holland (except they have the wrong trees here). Then come the foothills, changing into mountains. The road is no longer straight but goes up with switchbacks. At one point we have to wait for fifteen minutes at a traffic light where, because of roadwork, the road is single lane for a couple of miles. [20070714-182316]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We do see the sequoia trees, but we don&apos;t have time to stop for them. We need to continue on to the campsite because it is already getting late. [20070714-184136]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It is still light when we get to the campsite and start setting up, but by the time we&apos;re done it&apos;s dark. Nicoline is still making pancakes in the dark.

After breakfast (without coffee, because the propane bottle was empty) we went to the camp store to stock up on some necessities, as well as hotdogs and s&apos;mores for tonight. I tried to boil water over a camp fire, but that wasn&apos;t such a great idea. If I had had a kettle, it would have been justified in calling the pot black. Also, I don&apos;t think the pot&apos;s handles enjoyed the flames too much. The kids wanted to build a big camp fire to make s&apos;mores and to proof that they know how to start a fire. Yesterday, it took them a while to get a fire started (and then I almost choked on the smoke from some kind of moss-covered bark they put on it. Today they&apos;re supposed to build a fire the boy scout way (or whatever way they learned at Sandy Hill camp). &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The ranger wasn&apos;t kidding about bear activity in the area! We see a black bear cross the road in broad daylight. Unfortunately, we weren&apos;t fast enough to get picture. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After we put away the groceries in the bear safe, we drove to the Sherman Tree, which is the largest living thing on earth. [20070715-105246] These trees are huge! We saw some yesterday on the way to the campground, and I thought those were enormous, but the General Sherman was something else! [20070715-104429] [20070715-105137] [20070715-110603] [20070715-110221] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the Sherman Tree we hiked the Congress Trail which took us along on a path along a whole forest of sequoias. They were truly unbelievable! Sequoias can only grow in a 2,500 feet zone between 5,000 and 7,500 feet. They&apos;re also quite picky about the right soil conditions and moisture. The Park Service used to try and prevent fires among the sequoias, even though they are fire-resistant. However, research has shown that forest fires are actually a necessary part of sequoia development. If there is a thick carpet of needles and other debris on the forest floor, the seqoia seeds - which to my surprise turned out to be about the size of a flake of oatmeal - can&apos;t germinate and die. Their bark also doesn&apos;t catch fire like that of other pine trees. It will scorch and smolder, but it doesn&apos;t burn. [20070715-111508] Another reason these trees grow to the size that they do, is that their bark is very rich in tannin, which protects it from insects which infest other pine trees in the area.  When sequoias die, it is usually because they&apos;ve grown too big to keep standing and they fall over. [20070715-110114] [20070715-113147] [20070715-114339] [20070715-114556] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Even though we&apos;ve tried to prepare ourselves for hikes out here by doing segments of the Appalachian Trail, but the higher elevation (6,000 odd feet) really took it out of us today, sow e decided to head back to camp and take it easy. I showed the kids that I can start a fire (with two matches) by starting one while they went in search of a ranger to approve Mark&apos;s fire pit. [20070715-155841] In the end they decided that it would be easier to just set a fire in the fire pit provided, but it took them about half a box of matches to get it going. Anyway, we cooked hotdogs over the camp fire and then they built it up higher and higher for the s&apos;mores. It ends being a regular inferno! [20070715-170748] [20070715-174218] [20070715-184238] [20070715-201945]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;While we were eating hotdogs and s&apos;mores (well, OK, I ate Doritos because I&apos;m not big on marshmellows) we saw plenty of deer. They weren&apos;t very shy either. They just grazed right in the middle of the camp ground. [20070715-192159] [20070715-200648] [20070715-200740] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Seeing that many deer, we figured that there wouldn&apos;t be any bears around. However, in the middle of the night we wake up someone screaming \"Eliza! There&apos;s a bear!\" or something like that.

From forests and mountains we drive into plains so flat you&apos;d think you&apos;re in Holland (except for the palm trees, of course) to yet another mountain range (I never knew California had mountains other than the Sierras!) until we get to the coast.

Not so much tall maybe (although they are pretty tall) but big in volume. The famous General Sherman is volume-wise the biggest tree in the world. They get this big because at some point they stop growing in height but continue growing in width. Where other trees get so tall that they can&apos;t sustain the height at some point, sequoias just keep on growing bigger and bigger for thousands of years.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Sequoias are also picky trees. They only grow in the Sierra Nevada, and only on this side of the mountain, and only between 5,000 and 7,000 feet, and only with the right moisture. They tend to grow together in groups or \"groves\", surrounded by more normal pine trees. In fact, except for their typical red color, they look almost entirely like pine trees when they grow up.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I didn&apos;t know any of these things when we woke up. All I knew was that something had gone wrong with our gas bottle for the camp stove and Nicoline couldn&apos;t boil water - so no coffee this morning.

Of course, the camping here in Sequoia National Park is even more work because we had to take just about everything out of the car and into the bear-proof safe to prevent bears from trying to open up the car (they had some pictures of cars opened by a bear, and they just rip a door out of its frame... expensive little thing, and generally not covered by insurance, even apart from the hefty fine imposed by the park service for not following instructions).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, breakfast was not easily found.

What do you get, when you multiply nine by six? How is that 42 you may ask? Well, go through all the bases, starting at base 11, and tell me what base this question is in. I&apos;ll give you a hint. It&apos;s not base 7.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;ANYWAY, no more Hitch hikers guide to the galaxy quotes, on to what else I need to do.

We drive up the strip, and start heading back down. I just want to say, there are LOTS of wedding chapels! There is even a drive through wedding chapel! Amazing... I finally get the AT&amp;T commercial about the two kids going to Vegas, and the Mom worrying that they will get married... Funny... ANYWAY, We drive back and Frank and I want to go up into the Stratosphere and have a BALL!!! The building itself is 1000 feet up and windy. Frank and I want to do the rides, so we convince Mom and Dad, and they agree! I guess that they feel bad about us being in Vegas and not being able to do ANYTHING, seeing as we are not yet 21... *crys* But don&apos;t you worry, the rides were AMAZINGly fun!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The first one we did was called X-Scream, and what it does is: It puts you into a car and drops you down the ramp until the end, giving you the feeling that you are about to fall off, the it jolts, scaring the bahjesus out of you.

San Francisco is really not a city conducive to driving. For one thing, it is seriously hilly and it&apos;s near-impossible to park there. The train only took about 15 minutes, so it was really convenient.[20070717-094649] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The first thing we did was take a ride on one of the cable cars, which are a San Francisco attraction, [20070717-101511] but we also walked a good part of the way to down to Fisherman&apos;s Wharf. One of the things we had wanted to do was to take a ferry to Alcatraz, to visit the former U.S. prison which is now a national historic site. Unfortunately, ferry tickets tend to sell out about a week ahead of time, so we weren&apos;t able to do that. Frankly, I wasn&apos;t too upset about that. There was a pretty stiff breeze and the water in the bay looked pretty choppy to me. So instead we looked at the sealions [20070717-112858] [20070717-114922] [20070717-115500] [20070717-115649] [20070717-113850] and explored the wharf. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;What we found among the attractions of Fisherman&apos;s Wharf, was a place where they sold \"pommes frites\" the Dutch way. So we had to have that for lunch of course. Luckily, they didn&apos;t serve the condiments on top of the fries, as they would in Holland, which makes for rather messy eating. Instead they served the chipotle or pesto-flavored mayo in little plastic containers, and they gave you a styrofoam cup to hold the fries with. Heresy, but it works :-)[20070717-121840] [20070717-121857] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Fisherman&apos;s Wharf we walked back toward Ghirardelli Square, because I wanted to see the chocolate factory and see if their sundaes lived up to their reputations. They did. It was quite a walk, but worth it. They do seem to have rather an odd way of providing handicapped access, though. Look closely at the picture and note that the arrow with the little wheelchair symbol is actually pointing at a flight of stairs. The chocolate is great, but I already knew that. Even the kids agreed that it is much better than what they usually eat. (I keep the good stuff to myself, or I share it with Eric; they can have the Hershey&apos;s).

It was the end of the line, so the cable car has to be turned on a turntable to be able to go back. That was fun to watch! While we were waiting, Eric tried to get pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, but it was too far away and a bit foggy. When we finally got on the cable car, it was pretty crowded, so to their delight, Frank and Mark got to ride on the <i>outside</i> of the car.

The hippies are long gone, but it&apos;s still a funky neighborhood. Frank was pretty amazed to see the pipes and bongs sold quite openly in smoke shops and the proprietor of one saying that he could arrange for the real stuff to be sold to someone over 18 (moi). In case you are wondering, I thanked him politely, but passed. We had a bite to eat at the Red Victorian, a holdover from the Summer of Love (1967), because we wanted our food experience to match our city experience, and not spoil it by having something we could eat anywhere, like hamburgers or pizza or something. By then we were all pretty tired after walking around San Francisco all day, so we decided to head back. San Francisco treated us to one of its famous weather changes by having a low-hanging cloud descent on Haight Ashbury as we left the Red Victorian, to complete our tour.

Well, we would have driven through it if it hadn&apos;t been for the giant zit on the car&apos;s roof, but that&apos;s just nitpicking. The scenery on the way looked just the way both of us had imagined Oregon would look like. It&apos;s very beautiful, with all kinds of firs covering steep hill sides and rivers at the bottom of the valley.

Where you are bored beyond all belief. There&apos;s barely any civilization, either. Rather lonely place. [20070705-084844]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At any rate, we got to the Four Corners monument without much ado, and we all stuck our body parts in four different states at once.

The dust is like a massive sheet of sandpaper going against your body. Also, we came back into New Mexico for the last time before going on. That wasn&apos;t too bad â€“ both Arizona and New Mexico were getting really, really boring. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the Four Corners, we drove on to Mesa Verde, in Colorado. The altitude difference was rather extreme to our bodies, and all of us were getting light headed and tired, so we decided not to do a strenuous hike, but a calmer hike, with not too many dips and what not. It turned out to be a good idea.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There were warnings posted in the parking lot of the tour which we were preparing to do that there were professional thieves hanging around, so we hid the laptop under a chair, and got on our way to see the Pueblo dwellings. Down at the waiting area, we met our first (almost) fellow Netherlanders. We had a conversation (in dutch) with them, and went on our way. Actually, I didn&apos;t know it then, but there were a bunch more Netherlanders we were to meet. They seem to infest the west.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we went on this tour, and it really was something. The outlook at the tour waiting area itself gave an idea of what we were to see down at the actual dwellings. [20070705-172514] Once we got to the dwellings themselves, we saw that it really was very cool. It had started to rain, and we were sheltered from it down in the dwelling area. Those Puebloans were really very clever.

Imagine climbing up 100 feet with your belly being massive, and a big sack of corn or whatnot tied to your head... not easy to do.) and got back to our hotel, and, since the rain had cleared, we got an awesome view of the surrounding landscape. It really was cool. We got a really nice rate on the room too, we had thought it would be more expensive.

We were in Humboldt State Park, home to the Avenue of the Giants, but there&apos;s also the Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Redwood National Park about 55 miles from Eureka and several smaller parks, recreation areas and nature preserves in between. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I wondered why both species of giant trees grow only in California, so I asked a park ranger. He told me that these trees used to grow all over what is now the west coast of the United States, but climate change over several thousand years has left only two areas suitable. Sequoias and redwoods are actually cousins, if you look at their Latin names. Redwoods are \"sequoia sempervirens\" and giant sequoia are \"sequoiadendron giganteum.\" According to the park brochure, redwoods are so tall that they actually inhabit three climate zones and have two kinds of needles, broad flat ones at the bottom to catch as much light as possible, and thin ones at the top to prevent drying out by wind and sun. They also share the same fire and insect resistance, with a bark low in resin and high in tannin.

Some of the logs we saw would have fallen around the time the English first settled in Virginia! &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On of the trees on trail, called the Dyerville Giant, was estimated to be about 1,600 years old when it fell on March 24, 1991. That means it would have been standing when the Roman Empire fell! It was a sensation comparable to standing on the Porta Negra in Trier, Germany, which is probably only two hundred years or so older than the Dyerville Giant. [20070719-114945]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The only thing that was rather a pity about the Redwood Forest was that it was such a moist environment that we were nearly devoured by mosquitos. We had bug spray, but as we hadn&apos;t had to use it since Texas, it was in the car instead of where we needed it, i.e. our backpacks. Smart move, no?

It is the only surviving logging camp cookhouse on the west coast. Meals were served boarding house (=family) style and the \"all you can eat\" designation is a godsend with two teenage boys! We had pea soup with ham, salad, roast beef and pork, each with gravy, a baked potato each, peas and apple pie for desert. Very filling, but if you saw the pictures of the trees they felled with mostly hand tools and horse power, you could imagine the appetites these loggers brought to the table.

Some Kentucky idiots thought it was fun to feed it bit of white bread, even though you&apos;re asked not to feed wildlife at each and every national or state park we&apos;ve visted so far. It tends to make them aggressive and apart from training them to look to humans to feed them instead of getting their own food, it can also cause the wrong kind of bacteria to grow in their digestive tract. That leaves them unable to digest their natural food, and they starve to death on a full stomach. If that isn&apos;t the saddest thing you ever heard, I don&apos;t know what is. [20070720-155740]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The lake itself is at an elevation of about 6,600 feet (2200 m), so that explains it. In fact, part of the Rim Drive had only opened recently.

We started out, however, by driving through the Umpqua-Rogue River National Forest. It is one of the most beautiful areas I&apos;ve ever seen! In fact, I think that, all things being equal, I&apos;d choose Oregon over New Mexico, however beautiful the latter was. But that may just be my northwest European heritage speaking :-) [20070721-094425] &lf;&nl;[20070721-100518] [20070721-102242] [20070721-103453] [20070721-102439] [20070721-102657] [20070721-104414] [20070721-104316] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We turned onto I-5 at Roseburg and settled in for a day of driving. I worked on my diary until they all started yammering that they were hungry and wanted their lunch. (I had prepared ham and cheese sandwiches that morning). As you may know, today was the publication date of the last Harry Potter book, so we drove into Albany along the way to find a bookstore or some other place where they would have the book. We found a Target store nearly right away and bought two copies of the book, and that was that for the kids the rest of the day. Neither of them spoke another word, they were so engrossed in the book,  until we got to Vancouver, WA, where I wanted to see Fort Vancouver. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Fort Vancouver was an outpost of the British Hudson Bay Company and was an important fur trading center. At first it was supplied from England by sea or overland from Canada, but this was a rather expensive way of doing business as you can imagine. So they looked for ways of making the fort economically self-sufficient, such as by opening trade with China. However, this did not go over well with the trading firms who had been granted monopolies by the East India Company. Another way they tried was by growing their own crops and raising livestock, even though the staff complained that they didn&apos;t like the homegrown stuff and preferred the English foodstuffs they were used to. Meanwhile, in the 1830s, American settlers were pouring into the Willamette Valley by the hundreds. This was the end of the fur trade, but agricultural development really began to take off, especially after John McLoughlin took charge of the fort. He realized that the occupants of the fort could never hope to hold their own against a militia of well-armed settlers, should they become hostile toward the Hudson Bay Company, so he decided to stay on their good side by making loans to settlers and letting them borrow tools and seeds. This is how he became known as the \"father of Oregon.\" The fort was abandoned once the question of the northern boundary with British Canada was settled in the late 1840s. Some jingoists wanted to fight the English for possession of British territory as far north as what is now the southern border of Alaska, but President Polk realized he could not hope to win against the superpower of his day, so he instead picked a fight with Mexico and gained just about all of what is now the southwestern U.S. McLoughlin became a U.S. citizen and served as the first mayor of Oregon City. The U.S. Army established a military outpost there in 1849 and the list of former superintendents reads like a who is who of the Civil War: Grant, Sheridan, Pickett, and Howard all served there before the Civil War. It was renamed Fort Columbia in the late 1800s and it was one of the places where George C. Marshall served before he rose to fame as Chief of Staff, Secretary of State and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his brainchild, the Marshall Plan.

Husseyâ€™s book <i>The History of Fort Vancouver and its Physical Structure</i>, which was published in an edition of 1,000 in cooperation with the National Park Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1957. You can get it through an interlibrary loan from any Maryland public library. It might be a little harder to get a hold of outside the U.S, though :-)&lf;&nl; &lf;&nl;We got back on I-5 and drove on towards Seattle, which is about 150 miles from Vancouver, WA. The weather got progressively worse and by the time we were near Olympia, the rain was pouring down. We decided to try and find a place for the night, but there was some *&amp;^%$# soccer tournament in Olympia  and a *&amp;^%$#@# rodeo in the next town , so we drove to Tacoma in the pouring rain. We still had trouble finding a room there, but not because of a special event. It turned out the area where we tried to find a place for the night has some problems with prostitution and they try to prevent  \"immorality\" by asking for ID from both people who drive up. Not knowing that this was the problem, we were incensed at being asked to show both IDs, as if they wanted to make sure we were married. Well, they wouldn&apos;t have known that by looking at our driver&apos;s licenses anyway, since I go by my maiden name. Anyway, after a lot of driving up and down South Tacoma Parkway, we finally found an America&apos;s Best Value motel, and the guy at the check-in desk explained what was up with the ID check, so that&apos;s how we found out. By this time, Frank had finished his Harry Potter book, so after I had done a load of laundry (story of my life) and Eric was busily making backups on CD of the website, I stayed up until 1 a.m. reading.

I moved EVERYTHING to the back seat, so the middle bench had ALL the leg room. I actually could take a nap before lunch. We eat lunch at a Jack-in-the-Box, for reasons still unbeknownst to me... You should see the place mats they have at Jack-In-The-boxes all over, they are funny... We head off back to LA and after a short while, actually got there! We take a detour, being3 hours early. We head off to Beverly Hills. I really wanted to see the PD, since I was watching Beverly Hills Cop I-III on the way, but alas, no luck. I did get to see Rodeo Street, Sunset Street, and others. I even got to see the Hollywood sign! Well, from REALLY far away... ANYWAY, we get to LAX with plenty of time to spare, we even think that we saw Frank&apos;s plane arrive, but no, different plane, same time of arrival, same brand (Alaska Air)... What ever... ANYWAY, we get Frank from LAX and head up north. In Monte Carlo, we stop to go to the beach. First ever time seeing the Pacific Ocean! And touching it too! Yay!! We go straight through the mountains there, and go eat dinner at a weird smelling Oriental food place... Sad thing is, I forgot my hat there... and we were already 30 minutes away when I remembered... We get to a Motel 6 I think and crash. I guess superstitions really aren&apos;t real... Good night!

The view reminded me of a week previous, when I had flown into Seattle. The weather was almost the same too, which I found amusing. The weather was typical Seattle weather, cold, wet, and gray.

[20070722-114329]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There are no pictures of the actual inside of the factory because anything electronic was forbidden, including cell phones, pagers, etc. The factory is huge though, and we got a view of the new 787 under construction.

I can&apos;t stand the look of it...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We went back into the museum where we looked around, and I sat in the cockpit of a 727-200.

Haha!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We wake up in our tents after a stressful last night, but it doesn&apos;t get better. Mom, Dad, and Frank are all pissed that they don&apos;t get their coffee, because the valve broke or something to that effect... Anyway, Everyone is pissed, so the whole day starts off bad, but gets better, and FAST. We start our drive to the General Sherman tree, the largest tree in the world, and on the road guess what! WE SAW A BLACK BEAR!!! WE SAW A BLACK BEAR!!! Sadly, it was gone before we recovered from our shock and tried to take pictures. Darn... Oh well...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Well, we get to the parking lot for the big tree, and we realize that the 100 meters to the tree is not flat. In fact, it seems to be on a 75 degree incline... Well,we finally get there, and we sit around for the last bit of the ranger&apos;s speech. Sadly, we missed mos of it... This is when we really get to see the size of it. Even the \"foot print\" of the tree didn&apos;t show us how big it is, but it is HUGE! The pictures don&apos;t do it justice, it&apos;s that big! Anyway, the ranger finishes, and we move on. We do the congress trail, which has groves of trees that they named The Senate, House, Pres, but no Supreme Court, which I call the Justice league...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We finish that trip, and we go to the visitor center. I get a sweatshirt and an ice cream. Then we head to the museum. There, we look around for a while and decide to not take the four hour hike, seeing as we were all tired of the first one, and we were high up. We go back to the camp site and everyone but me takes a nice little nap. I gather fire wood and make a huge \"log cabin\" style fire. Well, I don&apos;t light it yet, because it isn&apos;t in the fire pit, but on a cleared sandy area. Mom wakes up, and yells at me for putting it there, she things the sand will catch on fore or something. By that time, everyone else is woken up, and Mom tells me, \"If you want the fire there, go ask the ranger to say if it is okay or not.\" So, Frank and I head out to ask the ranger, but halfway we decide that well just move it into the fire pit. When wee get back though, mom had started another fire! You have no idea how much that pissed me off... We put it out and Frank and I build a smaller fire to make the hot dogs on. We fry the hot dogs and eat them. They tasted REALLY good. After that, I light the fire in the fire pit, and made it HUGE. During the course of all that, we did see a lot of fearless dear wandering about. One came within 15 of us to graze! We made smores, but sadly, one of my marshmallows fell apart. [20070715-184238]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the marshmallows, were almost gone, I made a stick figure out of kindling, and put a marshmallow on top. I ate the marshmallow afterwards, of course.

Not after putting \"Old faithful\" (My \"poking\" stick) into the fire. To make sure that the fire didn&apos;t flare up again when it was ashes, I stayed out for a little bit. Or so they though. I took out my sleeping bag and slept next to the warm ashes. Middle in the night, someone was shouting, \"Eliza, A BEAR! COME OUT ELIZA, LOOK AT THE BEAR!!!\" They were rather annoying...

It isn&apos;t raining anymore, but it still is pretty cold and overcast. [20070723-101320]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We don&apos;t have any plans for the morning; our only goal is to go kayaking in the afternoon. So we spend the morning looking around the campground, which is right at the edge of the island. We see the large vessels go between the islands towards the Seattle harbor, we see the weirdly shaped seaweed floating around, and we even spot a purple starfish in the water. Slowly, as the fog starts clearing up a bit, we can see Vancouver Island (part of Canada).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070723-102223] [20070723-101806] [20070723-101942] [20070723-102516] [20070723-115246] [20070723-115429] [20070723-115534] [20070723-120215] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After lunch, we go to Roche Harbor to do the kayaking trip that Nicoline booked. When we can&apos;t find the place and Nicoline calls for directions, it turns out that they don&apos;t have a record of such a reservation, and they don&apos;t have a trip scheduled for this afternoon at all!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;If I&apos;m honest, I have to admit that I&apos;m of two minds of this news. On the one hand did I think the kayaking would be a cool adventure; on the other hand do I also have a lot of trepidation about this trip. I have had concerns about going out in wobbly kayaks from the start, and the fact that it&apos;s cold (maybe 65 degrees Fahrenheit, 18 degrees Centigrade) and the water is <b>really</b> cold doesn&apos;t help. However, I&apos;ve kept these concerns mostly to myself, since the others have been really looking forward to this part.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, the outfit that didn&apos;t have our reservation suggested to go into the town, on the dock, where there would be another company with kayak tours. We came there (San Juan Safaris), told them what happened, and asked if they had any tours available that we could join. No tours, but they also rented kayaks by the hour and would that be an option? They would provide a map and we could go out on the water on our own.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We decided to do it and they were very nice: because of all the trouble we had had, they only charged us for the double kayak Nicoline and I used; Frank and Mark got to come in single kayaks for free. So, here is a shameless plug for <a href=\"http://www.sanjuansafaris.com/\" >www.sanjuansafaris.com</a>&amp;mdash;they are very nice people! [20070723-135537]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So we go out on the Puget Sound and you know what? It isn&apos;t that bad at all. Even in shorts and flip-flops, I&apos;m not really cold. And the kayaks are really stable enough for me not to fear tipping over; enough so that I bring my camera and can shoot some memories of our adventures. [20070723-142403]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We don&apos;t see any whales or sea lions or animals like that, unfortunately. We do come across some seagulls when we paddle around the islands. [20070723-145830] And we see a bald eagle flying over.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At one place we find a lot of floating trash; it looks as if some grocery bag fell overboard. Mustard, butter, and freshly packaged fish. We pick what we can reach to throw out when we get back to land, although we open the fish packets and try to feed them to the seagulls. That doesn&apos;t quite work, though. [20070723-150631]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When we&apos;re already heading back to the dock, a seaplane lands right by us! [20070723-152001] That was quite an experience, of course, specially for Frank who follows the plane to the dock and chats with the pilot.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the kayaking adventure we change into somewhat dry clothes in the car and head back to our camp. We pass by an alpaca farm; these animals are cute!

All our pants got wet in the kayak, and most of the shirts as well. With the weather still very damp, there is not much change of these cloths drying. We manage a line between a tree and the car, but it isn&apos;t helping a lot.

[20070723-183606] Nice achievement, but the result is that the fire smokes horribly and everything ends up smelling of smoke!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Finally, when the sun is setting, we get to see it as it shines under the clouds.

The mountains of the Cascades, with the patches of snow on them, make for an idyllic picture.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Further along route 20 the landscape changes, much more arid instead of the timber lands that gave Washington its nickname of \"Evergreen State.\" [20070724-134845] Somehow, this landscape reminds me of commercials for cigarettes (is this the land of the Malboro Man?) or Western movies.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One of the towns we come through, Winthrop, looks much like a more modern version of a western town.

We do part of the Avalanche Lake trail but don&apos;t go all the way to the end. There are warnings for Grizzly bears here; [20070726-074917] we make sure to make noise when we&apos;re hiking today, so that we don&apos;t surprise the wildlife.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Since we are so early, we&apos;re the first ones on the trail. The first part is the easy part, they even have a kind of boardwalk so that this trail is actually wheelchair accessible. [20070726-074100]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The second trail is a different beast, though. We follow Avalanche Creek up through Avalanche Gorge, which is steep but gives us beautiful views.

I really should have taken my tripod on this hike, since it is so dark among all the trees. [20070726-083351]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the hike we have a quick snack (banana) and continue driving through the park. We now come in the really mountainous area.

The path is not specially difficult (some parts are boardwalk-style, although some parts are narrow paths) but it does go up quite a lot. You don&apos;t see many people who are seriously overweight taking this path! [20070726-103149]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Although all paths are describes in terms of their destination in the park brochure, the actual hike is more than worthwhile on its own.

We don&apos;t stay at the overlook too long, since it is infested with stinging flies. We also don&apos;t want to take the entire trail to the end (the lake itself) so we turn back to the parking lot. [20070726-112516]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After Logan Pass we continue to the east side of the park (stopping for one of the few diminishing glaciers for which the park is named) [20070726-124835] and then on to the Many Glaciers area. Glaciers have been shrinking for over a hundred years and \"global climate change\" isn&apos;t helping them any. Supposedly you can actually see the difference when you come back in a couple of years; no \"glacial speeds\" here.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At Many Glaciers, we take our third and last hike of the day, to Redrock Lake. This trail is fairly narrow but well-traveled. [20070726-140453] This is another 1.5 mile (one-way) trail; all together we have hiked something like 10 miles today when we finish this one.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The ranger said there were often moose at the Redrock Lake [20070726-144322] but we didn&apos;t see any. Actually, the only wildlife we see on this hike are crickets that make noise when they fly, not when they sit on the ground.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The lake is beautiful though, [20070726-144748] but when we come back to the car we&apos;re really done with hiking for today.

I don&apos;t know what went wrong, whether they transposed a number when they took the credit card number so the reservation couldn&apos;t go through, or whether I thought I had made a reservation with one when it was really the other...whatever. In the end, we were able to rent kayaks for ourselves and the kids for a tour of Roche Harbor at the northern end of the island. In fact, the owner let us have the kayaks for the kids for free, because he felt so sorry for us. So if you ever go to San Juan Island and feel like kayaking, go to San Juan Safaris! (See Eric&apos;s post for the link) [20070723-135537] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Kayaking was a lot of fun, despite the weather. We weren&apos;t allowed to take the kayaks out of the harbor - not that we would have wanted to, as novice kayakers - but we paddled about the harbor. We saw mostly water fowl, and we picked up some trash, so at least we left the place cleaner than we found it :-) This time it was apparently Frank&apos;s turn to get lucky, and he saw a sea plane land in Roche Harbor. He even got to chat with the pilot. You learn something every day: I didn&apos;t know they use the floats for storage.

At first Washington didn&apos;t look all that spectacular, but the farther we got, the more beautiful the scenery became. Diablo Lake, in north central Washington was beautiful! We had speculated that the greenish tint of the water might be caused by the presence of copper in the rocks, but it turns out it is the green shist which is ground to a powder finer than sand by glacier action and gets suspended in the lake water that gives it its peculiar color.

That&apos;s because Eric once had the opportunity to take a job in Kalispell - it was before the dot.com bubble burst - and I was all for moving to Montana. Luckily we didn&apos;t, or we would have been in serious trouble once the boom ended. Besides, Kalispell, or at least the little we saw of it, was quite disappointing.

Today, for instance, we had planned to just bunk down in Lewistown, MT, en route to Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota. When we checked in to the Super 8 motel in town, we learned that today was also the last day of the county fair, so we decided to go there and see if it was any good. The kids were mainly interested in the rides and typical fair ground snacks, but as it turned out there was going to be a rodeo at 7 p.m. I had been looking at rodeos before we left, but all I could find were those on the professional circuit, with admission fees to match, and while we were on the road, the only local rodeos I saw announced were either too far in the future or long past when we saw the sign. So of course we jumped at the chance of attending a real Montana rodeo! [20070727-172959] [20070727-173029] [20070727-183103] [20070727-183537] [20070727-184428] [20070727-184628] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Well, it was quite an experience. It started with a riding drill by a local team, followed by girls on horseback carrying flags of the companies sponsoring the event. Then the microphone was handed to a young lady who could not sing well enough to give her own rendition of the national anthem, but who tried - off-key - nonetheless. [20070727-185532] [20070727-185846] [20070727-190039] [20070727-190340] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After that, the real rodeo began with bareback bronc riding. The kids were incensed that they were hurting those horses, but I think they just raise them to be wild as deer. I mean, there wouldn&apos;t be any fun in watching a cowboy sedately ride around the ring, right? [20070727-191219] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then there was steer wrestling, the object of which is to wrestle the steer&apos;s head to the ground. Given how mean and ornery these monsters are, that&apos;s not easy. [20070727-191804] [20070727-192038] [20070727-192053] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Time for a commercial break. [20070727-192352] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The next event was calf roping, in which the idea is to lasso the calf, roll it on its back, tie its legs together and get back on your horse without the calf getting up. It probably wasn&apos;t a very pleasant experience for the calves, but they didn&apos;t seem hurt when they were untied and were herded into a pen on the opposite site of the ring by some of the same girls who had ridden around carrying the flags. They were obviously old hands at this kind of thing! [20070727-192945] [20070727-193005] [20070727-193007] [20070727-193013] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After that, there was a slate of ten cowboys trying their hands (and their behinds) at saddle bronc riding, which to me looked a lot like bareback riding, only with a saddle. [20070727-194649] [20070727-194657] [20070727-195022] [20070727-195151] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;One of the things I liked best was the ladies&apos; barrel racing event. Young women on horseback rode at full speed around a track made by a tractor with a harrow-type implement. The object is of course to complete the course around three barrels as fast as possible, without knocking over any of the barrels. I&apos;m sure these are people who must have practically been born on horseback, because I don&apos;t see how you could learn to do that otherwise! There was also junior barrel racing, which is the same thing done by kids. I don&apos;t know what the age cut-off is, but some of them seemed no older than 12. [20070727-195545] [20070727-200016] [20070727-200026] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Next came team roping, during which two cowboys lasso a calf. One rope is supposed to go around the horns, the other around the hind legs. How they make these ropes go exactly where they&apos;re supposed to go I have no idea. [20070727-200026] [20070727-202414] [20070727-202423] [20070727-202526] [20070727-202731] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl; Then came what Frank and Mark regarded as the \"real\" rodeo, bull riding. The idea is to hold on to a running and bucking steer for at least eight seconds with one hand. Most of the cowboys didn&apos;t even make it to eight seconds. They also had two lifesavers (the guys in the yellow and black) in the ring, whose job it was to rescue the cowboys once they fell off the steer, so they aren&apos;t trampled or gored by the bull.&lf;&nl;[20070727-203356] [20070727-203405] [20070727-203624] [20070727-203634] [20070727-203822] [20070727-203917] [20070727-203920] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;To keep the tension as high as possible, they divided the bull riding into two segments, with ladies&apos; breakaway roping and junior breakaway roping in between. With breakaway roping, the object is to lasso the calf, but not tie it down. I&apos;m sorry to say neither the ladies nor the juniors seemed much good at this. Perhaps it&apos;s something to do with men having better depth perception? Only a few ladies managed to get the rope around the calves&apos; horns. However, by this time it was getting too dark to take pictures from up in the stands, so unfortunately there are no pictures of these last two events.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Once the second round of bull riding was completed, the rodeo was over. I think the bull riding section was won by a black cowboy from Billings, which must have felt like sweet revenge for him. In between events, we were \"entertained\" by a rodeo clown, who was some local yokel performing in blackface. Among other things, he did a spoof on Michael Jackson, and generally acted like a stereotypical idiot. I could not believe that they still do that kind of thing A.D. 2007! [20070727-190814] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The kids still had some tickets for the rides left, and we also found some on the ground, so they went into the fun house mirrors and the cakewalk, and then it was time to go back to the motel and to bed.

It   is run by the Department of the Interior. As I had expected, it gave a bit of a biased view of American-Indian relations, although the museum itself wasn&apos;t established until the 1940s. The role American westward expansion played in the displacement of tribes and the atrocities committed in the name of \"Manifest Destiny\" are glossed over. It was interesting to see, however, that some of the plains tribes had trade items obtained from the Hudson Bay Company. What was also interesting was the fact that most artifacts donated to the museum had been in the possession of families with decidedly English-sounding names instead of Native-Americans. I found only two of the latter, a lady called Mable [sic] Little Bull and Daniel Buffalo. According to the lady who ran the gift shop and who was herself from the Blackfeet tribe, this is because during the 19th century a lot of settlers bought Native American items. Some were also owned by the railroads which were at the time being constructed on Indian land. Unfortunately, the museum didn&apos;t allow photography inside, so we only have pictures of the building&apos;s exterior.  According to the Blackfeet lady, today&apos;s disputes are not so much about land as about water rights. The land east of Glacier National Park is quite dry, so it is a very important issue, which according to her is being fought all the way to the Supreme Court.

Montana is one big, empty state!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Our first stop is at the Museum of the Plains Indian, which is run by the Department of the Interior. In spite of the dubious ownership, the museum was interesting in its displays.

[20070727-141419]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Around four we come to Lewistown, which is the last large town for a while, so we decide to stop here. There&apos;s a Super 8 Motel that has exactly one room left (at least, a room with a two queen-size beds, which is what we would want). The lady at the check-in tells us about the fair going on in town.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We do our usual unloading. Apart from the carrier on the roof of the minivan, which we always bring inside, we have a large duffel bag each, a backpack each, the computer bag and the camera bag, the food crate, the cooler, the bag with water bottles, and Frank and Mark each bring their own pillow. But, the rooftop carrier is always the most work to carry inside since it is heavy and pretty unwieldy. We don&apos;t dare holding it by the straps anymore; we used to do that but one of the straps has started to come loose and we don&apos;t want to put any more stress on it for fear of ripping it off entirely.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After unpacking and freshing up a little bit we go to the Central Montana Fair. The fair is fairly typical, [20070727-174256] with different attractions, 4-H presentations, [20070727-175224] street performers [20070727-180323] and different charities and churches selling wares. [20070727-173825]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Frank and Mark of course want to do some of the rides, [20070727-184628] in particular one where you hang upside-down half the time.

We have been looking for an opportunity to visit a rodeo, but didn&apos;t want to go to one of those commercial ones where you pay 60 or 75 dollars per person. This one was 9 dollars each, which is altogether more reasonable. [20070727-190340]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The event lasted about two and a half hours and included all kinds of different competitions. It seems the competitions (for time or points) had been going on all week; I don&apos;t think any better times or points were achieved today, but it still was interesting (and sometimes a little bit scary) to watch.

This park is the reason that I wanted binoculars. Which I got for my birthday LAST year. It&apos;s scary that the wild life here is not that wild. Take the marmots for example, they would come right up next to me and under the walkway to get the flowers. They weren&apos;t even scared when some kids yelled and screamed and ran right next to him! Scary... And the mountain goats! 7 of them were standing right a well traveled road, and one of them was sleeping! But, the one that&apos;s sleeping, sure does look happy! Positively gleeful!

We drive to Glacier Nat&apos;l &lf;&nl;Park and plot which trail we will do first. We choose the Avalanche Trail. The first part is a nice wooden, wheelchair accessible path, but then it gets to the part where the trail begins. It&apos;s about two and a half miles long one way and it is not for the faint hearted. The trail itself follows the creek. And what a creek it is. Beautiful!

We drive off to Logan Pass next. We get there around 10 AM. To look at the view, and we spot a family of mountain goats, just sitting by the side of the road, boy are they cute! [20070726-095337] The one at the top of the post looks so happy... We also notice a cute little ground squirrel that feels like posing for my dad. Over and over... Well, at least we got good pictures!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We continue to the visitor center, and we do the \"Hidden Lake\" Trail. It is a not strenuous trail that takes you to a lake that is supposedly hidden. Well, I&apos;ll say the truth, the lake wasn&apos;t as cool as I thought it would be, but the walk to it! Ohhhhh, can&apos;t wait to tell you guys...! [20070726-112516]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Okay, I&apos;ll warn you, you will want to visit Glacier if you here this. So, if you don&apos;t want to travel anytime soon, skip down to the paragraph after this one. Okay, now on the what we saw. Hm... If you want me to rattle them off, you are mistaken. Well, we started walking down the trail, and we see QUITE a few ground squirrels, and, on our way up we also see a few Marmots. They are cute, large rodents. But cute! After them, we notice five big horn sheep grazing on the grass not 300 feet away. They were incredibly cute!!! Well, after we pass them, we see two more running off in the distance, then three more mountain goats, walking right next to the path, one of them a baby. We finally make it up and at the top are even more mountain goats by the look out area. We decide not to take the route another 1.5 miles down to the lake, but are content with just looking at it. After endless ground squirrels, we had made it to the top, and now it was time to head back down again. On the way down we see many more marmots. Along with two more big horn sheep. The ground squirrels still out number the rest of the animals at 17. We arrive at the bottom, and sadly, have to leave. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;On towards Many Glaciers. Supposedly, we are supposed to be able to see bears there. Meh, when we get there, I am a bit disappointed that there are no bears in sight. Nor mouse, or elk, or any others... Sad... Oh well, I still have a chance to see the Grizzlies in YellowStone. Theres always later... Humph. Well, after that, we head back to the motel room.

Sometimes I drove for 20, 25 miles without seeing a single house. Imagine living in an area like that. You could hardly call the people who live nearest neighbors. Sometimes we would see a mailbox, but no house. I guess the people whose mail is delivered to that box need to drive over to pick it up. I only wish I could imagine what it would be like to live in such lonesome spot, but I&apos;m afraid that once you learn to live in a place like that, you&apos;ll never be able to go back to suburbia. [20070728-100010] [20070728-113955] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The other thing that struck me is the variety of the landscape.

The goal for today was Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We had chosen to visit this park because it was supposedly as beautiful, but much quieter, than Yellowstone.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The trip through Montana reminded us a lot of the Badlands in South Dakota, where we were almost exactly 9 years ago (on August 14, 1998, to be precise). The landscape consisted of rolling hills with grass on them, as well as wheat. At times there  were little canyons (a couple of feet only) in them. [20070728-100023] Kind-of like badlands in miniature.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Then there were stretches that were much more barren and rougher, like the badlands we&apos;ve seen nine years ago. [20070728-114433] Not completely uninhabitable yet (and there were still fences all over the place) but it still brought back memories for Nicoline and me.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The other noticeable thing about Eastern Montana is how empty it is. We were obviously following a major road (the Montana state route 200), and according to the map it was just about the only major road in 50 miles. There were signs of habitation (apart from the continuous fence along the road), but they were few and far between. We did see other cars&amp;mdash;a few of them. For long stretches the road just went on and on...

When we got to the Fisherman&apos;s wharf, we realize that the tickets to Alcatraz were sold out far into next week, so that&apos;s a no go... Like I said, the jail part sucked.

We walked farther down Pier 39 and noticed all the tourist traps. Some of which were rather interesting. Mom told me that Dad had gone to look at the sea lions, so I went running off after him, trying to see them. As it turns out, not to many were there, because most of them had gone to Mexico to mate. We ate the fries and Mom and I went to see a street performer be REALLY funny. shortly thereafter, Dad and Frank joined us. We walked around on the upper level of pier 39 while we waited for the next show. I got to sit in the front row and he gave me a dollar for picking up a stick he dropped. He dropped it again later and told me not to get out of your seat, \"You are way to expensive.\" After that, we decided to walk down to the turnabout. Where the cable cars are turned.

During the Civil War he fought with a number of Kansas regiments on the Union side and after the war acted as a scout during the Plains Indians campaigns. Among other things, he saw action against Sitting Bull in 1876. He also freelanced for the army as a buffalo hunter, thus earning his sobriquet \"Buffalo Bill.\" [20070730-153423] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Buffalo Bill became most famous as the owner-operator of a legendary Wild West show, which toured the country and even Europe until just before World War I. At the height of its success, the show included 600 performers and 500 heads of livestock, with housing and equipment to match. The show was seen by Kaiser Wilhelm and Queen Victoria - who is said to have been amused by it - among others. At one point the show even featured Cossacks among the riders. [20070730-160458] [20070730-155903] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;According to one of the exhibits at the museum, the Buffalo Bill&apos;s show was both a boon and a curse to Native American culture. It was a boon in that Cody did not discriminate against Native Americans in his shows. Instead, they were an integral part of the show and this allowed them to hold on their culture as much as possible. Cody also encouraged them to bring their families on the road. At the same time it was a curse, because most of the Native-Americans who joined Buffalo Bill&apos;s show were Sioux and this has led to the skewed image of in which the Sioux tribe has become synonymous with Native-American culture to the detriment of other tribes. Indeed, it was not until I visited the Plains Indians Museum in Browning, MT, that I learned that Blackfeet warriors wore eagle feather war bonnets in which the feathers pointed straight up, instead of slanting backward from the wearer&apos;s head like those of the Sioux, for instance. These stereotypes were also perpetuated by the western-themed dime novels featuring Buffalo Bill.   Native American culture was already severely threatened by the encroaching white culture, an aspect of the history of the West that the museum didn&apos;t gloss over as much as the museum in Browning. The 19th century attempts at stamping out Native American culture, such as the Indian boarding schools and forcing Native Americans to live in houses just like white settlers are part of the exhibits, too. There was also quite a bit of information on contemporary Native American culture and the revival of cultural traditions like beadwork in a contemporary setting.

But as soon as we entered Yellowstone, the scenery changed for the worse. There was a lot of evidence of more or less recent wildfires, but there were also lots of dead trees in areas that hadn&apos;t been scarred by fire. Yellowstone Lake was pretty, but nothing out of the ordinary really.

There were just way too many people there. We should have read the statistics on Yellowstone more closely, I guess. In 2006, a total of 2.8 million people visited Yellowstone, of which 1.9 million came during June, July and August! I know the National Parks are paid for with tax dollars and all that, but someone ought to think up some way of limiting the number of visitors to some reasonable number so you can actually enjoy the park, as opposed to fighting your way through the crowds to see a single solitary elk! [20070731-144035a] Suppose they were to take reservations, say 500 cars, plus a number of say another 250 on a first come, first served basis. IMHO, they should also have a shuttle that could serve both those who want to hike the trails or the back country and people who only want to see Old Faithful or any of the other standard touristy things. That would really improve the Yellowstone experience, if you ask me. Of course we also visited Old Faithful, along with a couple of hundred other visitors. We also ran into a couple who were not only from Maryland, but from Ellicott City! [20070731-125645] [20070731-131201] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Nobody is asking me, of course, but I offer my opinion anyway. I am also of the opinion that if you want to see a beautiful Wyoming national park, go to Grand Teton instead. It&apos;s just to the south of Yellowstone and even though the South entrance road to Yellowstone leads through Grand Teton, it is much quieter and therefore much more enjoyable than Yellowstone. We went there after we had given up on Yellowstone, and it was much nicer. We had a picnic dinner on the bank of String Lake, where the water was incredibly clear and we saw lots of wildlife.

No, you may not. I&apos;m just here because I love history, not because of any religious conviction (or lack thereof). &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There are a number of religious statues on the square, but also statues of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. Smith founded the Church of the Latter-Day Saints (LDS) after purportedly receiving a vision in the early 1820s saying that there was no true church of Christ on earth and that God called Smith to right this wrong. He also received the Book of Mormon from the angel Moroni. Since he was of course loathe to call the new religion moronic, he decided to call it Mormonism.[20070802-150752] [20070802-145059] [20070802-145123] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;He was then apparently called to the priesthood of this new church. In subsequent visions, he was was supposedly given to understand that he must found \"Zion\" in which the faithful could live on reservations, safe from persecution. The believers first traveled to Ohio, then to Missouri and Illinois, only to be run out of all of these states. Joseph Smith was killed while imprisoned in Carthage, IL and the council of elders then elected Brigham Young as his successor. He led the community out of the settlement in Illinois they called Nauvoo and into a winter encampment in Nebraska. [20070802-145247] [20070802-145604] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The following spring the Mormons traveled on to what is now Salt Lake City, where they began building the temple in 1853. It was not finished until 1893, just three years before Utah gained admission to the United States on January 4, 1896 as the 45th state. Statehood would have come earlier, if it hadn&apos;t been for the \"twin relics of barbarism,\" slavery and polygamy, which had by then been accepted as tenets of LDS faith. According to a website maintained by the <a href=\"http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html\">Utah State Historical Society</a>, several attempts at Utah statehood were made, starting as early as 1849-50, but all of these foundered on the practice of polygamy. It wasn&apos;t until Mormon leaders began to see that it would be more in their interest to have anti-polygamy statutes enforced by their own elected officials than by hostile outsiders that acceptance of a state constitution with a clause prohibiting polygamy became possible. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Interestingly, the Museum of Church History and Art located just across from Temple Square makes no mention whatever of polygamy, either in the past or the present, or of the less-than-stellar record of LDS when it comes to racial equality, but in fairness to the Mormons, I wouldn&apos;t expect to get an entirely unbiased view of Roman-Catholic doctrine or church history in St. Peter&apos;s Square either. Still, it is interesting to read the list on the back of Brigham Young&apos;s statue. [20070802-145748] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Nevertheless, Brigham Young should have known better than to change winning formula. He supposedly had a heavenly vision in which the building plans for the temple as well as its layout on the - yet to be constructed - square were revealed to him. I suppose this accounts for the fact that it is difficult to get the sort of sweeping vision of a grand cathedral overlooking a square that you find in Rome and other European cities, and an ugly 1960s-looking administrative building - where they apparently keep track of all Mormons around the world - towers over the temple itself.

We got to Lava (as I&apos;m going to call it from now on) at around 1:30-1:45 PM.

Very wet... We get out again to jump off the second one, and it&apos;s just a little bit harder then jumping off the first... Seeing as it&apos;s ten feet higher up... Well, Frank and I both jump, and then it comes to do the third. The one that is 33 feet hight, 10 meters. Frank and I both mutually agree that we should do the second one more time, and we walk down one flight of stairs. We jump off, then we decide to brave the third jump. We climb up all the stairs and we stand at the top. Frank was the first one to jump, the brave soul. Then after a few more people, I go. It&apos;s a funny sensation, you just fall. You see the water getting closer, but it takes such a long time. SUCH a long time. But it really doesn&apos;t. When I was jumping off the second platform again, I counted how long it took someone to jump off the third. 1.5 seconds. The second platform, 1.1 seconds. The first? .9 seconds.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Well, the platforms weren&apos;t the only thing to do, there were water slides, a diving pool, diving boards, and a fun shallow end. It really was a BLAST.

We then beg Mom and Dad if we can go to the pool at midnight, just because it is a 24 hour pool. They, after some persuasion, say yes, and we go back to the room. We watch some TV, and turn in.

A little bit later we come to what seems to be a wildfire; helicopters are flying to and fro with water buckets, but we don&apos;t see any actual fire.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070802-110701] [20070802-110717] [20070802-111654] [20070802-111741]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We find a hotel in Salt Lake City early, then Nicoline and I want to go downtown while Frank and Mark prefer to stay in the hotel pool. We walk around Temple Square, not having much of a clue what we&apos;re looking at. There is a \"visitor center\"  but that doesn&apos;t seem to have something as simple as a map of the area with an explanation what it what. It looks more like a lot of propaganda of the Mormon variety of \"family values.\"&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070802-144112] [20070802-144456] [20070802-145059] [20070802-145604]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So I basically take pictures at random, but what the heck. The temple itself is obvious, although it turns out we approach it from the back (I figure that out when I take a picture of the angel Moroni at the top, and see through the tele lens that I&apos;m looking at the back of the angel).&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;When we get to the front of the temple, there is a much better view of the building. I was already starting to doubt if they even wanted the temple to be seen (we had a hard time spotting it among the skyscrapers driving into town). But I still think it is remarkable, to say the least, that the  <em>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Office Building</em> so much overtowers the religion&apos;s main temple.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070802-150532] [20070802-150752] [20070802-150248]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After walking around the temple, we visit the tabernacle, which is open for visitors to see. [20070802-151530] This is where the Tabernacle Choir regularly sings. They surely have one grand organ there. Most impressive, though, was the demonstration of the acoustics of the building. There was a lady standing at the front, talking in a normal voice, and we could perfectly hear it in the back. She shred some newspaper and it was as if it happened right in front of us. Really, really amazing.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After visiting Temple Square I went inside the Family History Center; this is the famous library of the Mormon church that is used by genealogists worldwide. They have rows and rows and rows of cabinets with thousands, maybe millions of microfilms. [20070802-154248] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The building has five floors with research centers for different regions of the world. I looked over the area of European research; [20070802-154513] they had plenty of Dutch genealogical reference works on top of all the microfilms. I didn&apos;t try to do any specific research, I would have needed to prepare for that, but it was impressive to see.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Back at the hotel, Nicoline does the laundry while (it seems as if that never ends!) while the kids continue to play in the pool.

We got up around 6, and put everything on and inside the car. We ate breakfast, and drove out to Salt Lake International, not too far from the hotel.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;My father went inside with me into the check-in area, where we printed my E-ticket for Delta/SkyWest flight 3938, after some struggling with the machine. There was nothing to do at the check-in side of the terminal, so I decided to head through security, and walk around on the other side. The line for security was long, but I got through without any problems.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At the other side, after putting my shoes on, I decided to walk over to my gate in the E concourse (E77, with the physical gate being E39). It was just a door, and boarding was two and a half hours away, so I decided to walk around the terminal a while. I bought myself a $1.75 Coca-cola with a $5 bill, and the machine gave me back 2 dollar-coins, something I&apos;ve never seen a machine do before.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;As I walked around, I met a family from Holland. They were sociable enough, but they had a 16 hour trip ahead of them, so I left, and went back to the gate area. I found a chair and watched the incessant coverage they had about that collapsed bridge.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;There was a flight departing to Eugene, Idaho, which needed volunteers, but the gate attendant had put the volunteer sign under my Denver flight. I was going to volunteer, and get a later flight, plus a travel voucher, but it was the wrong flight :(. I wanted that travel voucher.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At 10.40, the flight began boarding, and I was among the first on board. I didn&apos;t ask to see the cockpit this time, since the CRJ-200 I was flying was rather small, and other people obviously wanted to get to their seats. I sat down in seat 10A, and made myself comfortable.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We took off exactly at 11.24, off of runway 16R, after taxiing on F3, B, and A11. The ascent went smoothly, and the takeoff noise wasn&apos;t to bad, even being that close to the engine. The 10,000ft ding came quickly, and as the flight attendant came by, I got a coke and a bag of crackers.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The flight was at cruise for around 40 minutes long, and the descent began quickly. We passed through cloud layers with the occasional thump of turbulence, but otherwise smoothly. Soon, we had lined up parallel to an American Airlines MD-83 for a simultaneous approach to 16L (them) and 16R (us). We touched down at exactly 12.24 local time, after a flight of 1 hour and 2 minutes.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After touchdown, we taxied off of the runway at D3, passing runway 16L at WB, continuing on G then CS, finally arriving at gate C44. As we deplaned, I purposefully made myself the last one out, to be able to talk with the pilots, and I learned some details about the aircraft, and the ride. I shall list them below, for anybody who cares:&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<ul><li>Aircraft was CRJ-200 (I knew that)</li>&lf;&nl;<li>Reg: N431SW</li>&lf;&nl;<li>Route: TCH J56 CHE.TOMSN4</li>&lf;&nl;<li>V1-135 VR-138 V2-141</li>&lf;&nl;<li>Vref45 â€“ 141, with a -2.2* nose down pitch on approach.</li></ul>&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;I walked off the aircraft into the terminal, and looked for a place to eat. I called my brother to tell him I was in Denver, and learned they were half way there. I ate a quick lunch at the McDonalds in the C terminal food court, while watching a Northwest A320 park at the adjoining gate. It really is interesting to see.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After lunch, I explored the terminal a bit more, and decided that there wasn&apos;t enough to see, and to go on to the A and B terminals. I boarded the train to the A/B gates, and, the announcer who announces the train is arriving makes it sound like an achievement... he got <i>really</i> annoying. At any rate, I walked around the A gates, and made a video of the Lufthansa A340-300 being pushed back for Munich, which was a really interesting thing to watch.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After watching the push back, I went to the United terminal, at terminal B, and sat down for a while, waiting for a B777-200 to arrive from San Francisco. As I was sitting, a pilot arrived who was dead heading to Chicago, and was hoping for a standby seat on the United flight. I talked with him, and learned a lot about the airline business, until my mother called, telling me they were waiting for me in front of the east terminal. I walked out there, and got in the car.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We drove to a Chili&apos;s for dinner, but I didn&apos;t eat much. We drove on to Castle Rock, and checked into a Quality Inn there. We learned that it was a good idea not to drive down to Colorado Springs, because <i>every</i> hotel down there was booked solid, due to about 5 different conventions going on at the same time.

This was the interesting part. This pool was an Olympic training pool, with dimensions to match. It even included three diving platforms, one at around 4 meters, one at 7 meters, and the last at 10 meters [20070801-142342]. Of course, Mark and I had to jump off of them. We got our waivers, and headed to the first platform, 4 meters off the ground. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;This being the first time I&apos;ve ever jumped off of something this tall, I was rather nervous. I did jump off, and went up to the 2nd platform. After jumping off of that one 3 times, I thought I was ready to go up to platform 3, 10 meters off the ground. I looked over the edge, and that was it. I went back down to platform 2, and jumped off of that one.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;This time, I went back up to platform 3, and waited for everyone else to jump off. It was my turn. I took a few steps back from the edge, and ran up to, and over the edge. The feeling that came next was very, very interesting. The feeling of falling, and your arms aren&apos;t doing anything but being a nuisance. It is a very weird sensation, feeling nothing under your feet, 33 feet up in the air. Hitting the water is also not exactly comfortable. In fact, after jumping off the third platform 8 (yes, 8!!!) times, I was rather sore.

The state of Colorado is apparently desparate for revenue, since both the road to the airport and the road to Pikes Peak were toll roads. Furthermore, there were entirely too many people on the road to Pikes Peak, so that we would have had to drive in some kind of rush hour traffic to get there. The view was supposed to have been worth it, but no thanks. [20070804-103405] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So we gave up the idea of Pikes Peak, and drove away from the mountains towards the plains instead. I had always thought that the prettiest part of Colorado would be in or near the mountains, but actually the plains were far more beautiful. Not only because there were far fewer people around, but because of the wide open space.

[20070804-133539] [20070804-133844] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Sand Creek was the site where a band of Colorado volunteers murdered the inhabitants of a Native-American encampment, the leader of which, a Cheyenne named Black Kettle, had concluded a peace treaty with the U.S. not three months before. The commander on whose watch these atrocities were committed was Col. John M. Chivington. He later testified before a Congressional committee investigating the massacre that he believed the encampment to house warriors hostile to the U.S. We thought it was important to show our kids not just the achievements of white Americans in fulfilling their \"Manifest Destiny\" but also that land now used for grazing cattle and growing crops had been bought and paid for in blood. Such clashes of civilization happened all over the world, not just in the Americas, but the difference here was of course the fundamental inequality between tribes of hunter-gatherers and a technologically highly developed people in whose eyes the land just cried out for agricultural development. At any rate, I was pleased to see that the town of Chivington is far from a thriving farming community. In fact, it seemed as good as deserted. The site of the massacre - or rather, from where the attack was launched - is marked by a single granite monument, where people have left small mementos of their visit. We added the palm leaf rose that a homeless man in Galveston had made for us. Present-day Native-Americans also have annual ceremonies during which they remember the massacre, the park ranger told me. Sand Creek is the newest national park. It opened on June 1, after the site had been closed to the public for many years. The land was apparently in private hands, and some people had vandalized the memorial before the park service acquired both. There is as yet no visitors center, although one may be built in Chivington.

When planning the trip, we looked for opportunities for Frank to fly between big cities while we would drive the same distance. There weren&apos;t many of those, because we weren&apos;t planning to visit many big cities in a row. The first time was between Vegas and Los Angeles, and today would be the second opportunity. [20070803-080209]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;With Frank flying, we get up early, drop him off at the airport, and then hurry while he does a whole lot of waiting. I had expected today to drive from Utah through the Rocky Mountains to Denver, but it turns out we are basically driving around most of the mountains: the I-80 takes us slightly up, all the way through Wyoming to Cheyenne, then along the Rockies to Denver. We did look at taking the other Interstate (I-70), which would have given us the opportunity to go through Cove Fort, the Western I-70 end point. My place of work is at the Eastern end point of the I-70 and every day on my way home I see a sign \"Cove Fort 2300\"; it would have been cool to actually visit the other end of this road. But unfortunately that would add 150 miles to today&apos;s trip, which is already more than long enough. [20070803-081614]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;So, we drop off Frank and start going. After crossing the mountains directly East of Salt Lake  City, the landscape is more hills than mountains. We seem to be going parallel to train tracks, as we see one freight train after another. One of them even has a whole bunch of UPS trucks on it. [20070803-091530] I never realized that when you ship something through UPS, they ship their trucks by train, but I guess it makes sense if it&apos;s planned well.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;At one point, we passed one eastbound train after another, all of them standing still. Each of these trains is probably a mile long, and we passed at least six in a row. Who ever heard of a backup of trains?

It actually isn&apos;t easy to find; there are no signs on the state road and the approach is a ten-mile dirt road.

There is a simple stone marker at the site, [20070804-153610] where people have left little tokens of remembrance. We feel it is appropriate to leave here the palm-leaf rose we got in Galveston, TX. We have been carrying this rose around since June 29, stuck in the dashboard.

Parents are warned not to let children under 12 walk through this part of the exhibit alone, as it is very intense.

There was a picture there of Catholic kids in Northern Ireland requiring police protection to travel through a Protestant neighborhood on their way to school, or maybe it was vice versa, I forget, but this kind of thing is still happening in the 21st century.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Of course we ended up in the bookstore and I wished I could have bought a copy of nearly every book they displayed. That being impossible, I decided on \"Brown v. Board of Education. A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy\" by James T. Patterson. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From the National Historic Site we drive through Topeka to the post office to mail home a bunch of flyers, brochures and other stuff we&apos;ve picked up on the way, as well as a set of DVDs that Eric made as a backup of the website, so we wouldn&apos;t have to lug about pounds and pounds of paper. The idea is to use some of these flyers and things in a collage on the dining room wall at home (assuming the house is still standing after eight weeks :-)), together with some of the best pictures of our trip.Check out the R2D2 mailbox in front of Topeka&apos;s main post office.

Instead of a linear path one could take, there were all kinds of different displays that were interesting, but I felt the big story was lost in the many details.

By the time we went to sleep, we were wondering about the wisdom of that decision. It had started to rain, and it seemed the thunderstorms continued all through the night. Theoretically, the carrier can handle that but it has been in the burning sun for over 6 straight weeks now, in 65-miles-an-hour \"winds\" and being dragged off and on the car almost daily, so it is no wonder it is starting to loose some of its strength.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;It&apos;s still raining in the morning and the forecast is for the thunderstorms to continue through most of the day. We don&apos;t even bother trying to find out what happened inside the carrier, just cross our fingers and drive away. [20070808-082916]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;First stop today the National Homestead Monument [20070808-092634] in Beatrice. Homesteading is the practice of the government giving people a \"free\" piece of land, under the condition that they live on the land and farm it for at least five years. It started in this form with the Homestead Act of 1862 and continued into the 1980s. However, it was the homesteading of the 1860s that really shaped the American continent.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The National Homestead Monument tried to show all aspects of the homesteading. Not only the successes but also the failures, the fact that the \"free\" land was obtained by forcing the Native Americans from their land, the speculation by the railroad companies and the deceit that went with it. Only 40% of the homesteaders actually fulfilled the condition of living on and working the land for five years. And many of those that did get the land weren&apos;t able to make it profitable. [20070808-095220]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070808-101539] [20070808-101545] [20070808-101549] [20070808-101552]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We saw a homestead cabin, and this one was relatively luxurious, as it was made with wood. [20070808-102506] Many homesteaders had land in places without trees, and they had to make their initial homes out of not much more than mud. The cabin we saw was a single room, with a bed, a table, two chairs, a stove and a small cabinet. That&apos;s all. We probably carry more \"stuff\" in our car on this vacation than people had in their homestead...&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070808-102744] [20070808-102821] [20070808-102812]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Beatrice we went north again, past Lincoln, up to a town called Columbus, Nebraska. Here we visited the Andrew Higgins memorial. Higgins was the founder of Higgins Industries and designer of the landing craft that were so instrumental in the second World War. [20070808-133603] It was these landing craft that enabled D-Day in Europe and many invasions in the Pacific. Without them, the allied forces would have had to conquer heavily fortified harbors, rather than be able to invade less fortified beaches.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The memorial was created by the Columbus High School and was very impressive. It was a tribute not only to Higgins himself, [20070808-134830] but also to the soldiers of World War II, the Korean and the Vietnam war, and included a September 11 memorial as well.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Columbus, we turn east and intend to be following the US-30 highway through multiple states just about all the way to Chicago. We&apos;ll be doing a lot of driving the next few days! For today we end up in Ames, Iowa. We go out for a Chinese dinner, which was a great success, and ice cream as dessert.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We have been lucky to day that almost all the rain fell when we were in the car. [20070808-083810] We had a few drops when we were visiting the homestead in Beatrice, and a few more during our ice cream dessert here in Ames, but not much, and it was dry when we were visiting the memorial in Columbus. However, a little bit of rain did get into the carrier on the roof of the car. I&apos;ve turned it around because I think the front part may have worn more than the back part.

They&apos;ve opened a new building just this year, and it is shaped to look like an old-fashioned plow from a distance. We began by looking at the introductory movie, which gave a pretty good overview of the history of the 1862 Homestead Act and how settlers were sometimes lured to rather marginal lands by the prospect of \"free\" land and unscrupulous advertising practices. I was amazed to see that Florida was one of the states covered under the Homestead Act; but of course it had variously been in Spanish and British hands before becoming a state in the mid-1840s, I think. Under the Act, anyone over 21 years of age who was a head of household could file a homestead claim. If he (or she; widows and single women also qualified) lived and worked on the land for five years, the settler would gain title to the land. Of the western states, Montana had the most successful homesteaders, while Alabama settlers were the most successful settlers back east. I&apos;m not sure that the numbers would look the same if the number of claims relative to the size of the state and or territories is taken into account. I was also surprised to learn that the last homestead claim was filed in Alaska in the mid-1980s. [20070808-105511] [20070808-104109] [20070808-093043] &lf;&nl;[20070808-093052] [20070808-101110] [20070808-105137] [20070808-105049] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The reason Homestead National Monument is located in Nebraska is that it was the site of the first claim filed when the Homestead Act went into effect and because Nebraska had the largest percentage of land open to homesteading. The original claim has since been allowed to revert to tall grass prairie. An effort to restore the original flora of the plains has been under way since the 1930s Dust Bowl, after unlimited sod busting combined with a prolonged drought to blow away the fertile topsoil of much of the plains states. [20070808-103534] [20070808-103551] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;From Beatrice we drove on to Columbus, where we wanted to see the Andrew Jackson Higgins Memorial. I also came across the cleanest, nicest gas station restroom I have ever seen. Guys - at least my three - don&apos;t seem to understand that relieving myself is a little more difficult for me than it is for them, and my anatomy requires that I find facilities that are at least moderately clean. Well, this restroom was. If any of you ladies out there ever travel in Nebraska, use the ladies&apos; room at the BP at Nebraska highway 92 and NT country road, just west of the town of Wahoo.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, to continue my story about the Higgins memorial. Higgins was the owner of Higgins Industries, Inc. which built, among other things, the landing craft used in the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy. It was pretty amazing to see that the memorial was built over a period of three years as a service project by a local high school. They certainly did an excellent job! Not only does the memorial contain a life-size replica of a landing craft, it is situated on a patch of sand composed of sand from beaches where the landing craft were used. Not only D-Day and Sicily, but also throughout the Pacific and after World War II when American troops landed on Inchon during the Korean War and during the Vietnam War, when Marines waded ashore at Danang. They even have replicas of \"Rommel&apos;s asparagus,\" steel barriers that were supposed to prevent an Allied landing.

Even with all the industrialization, and we&apos;ve seen plenty of factories, plants, office blocks and the like, I can&apos;t help thinking that we <em>really</em> saw the agricultural backbone of the U.S. on this trip. Right now we&apos;re driving through Illinois, and earlier today Iowa, with one corn field after the other. In the northwest there was miles and miles of timber; in-between a lot of cattle. All over the place when there was water, we saw signs for fish hatcheries.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<strong>Car dealerships.</strong> [20070809-120339] Actually, all kinds of larger retail stores, but I specifically noticed the car dealerships in every larger town. If you realize that all of these dealerships need to sell a significant number of cars to be profitable, and the number of car dealers there must be, it gives you some idea how many cars there are here. Same for grocery stores, for Walmart, and so on. And not to forget the hotel chains, which we&apos;ve seen up-close so often. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<strong>Highways.</strong> [20070809-145215] I think I mentioned this before, in New Mexico, but I have to agree that the best way to see the country is not through the interstates. The old US highway system may be a bit slower, but following those roads gets you much more in touch with the country. On Interstates, you just fly by everything. The highways sometimes go around towns, but sometimes also go right through them, enough to get a feel for them.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<strong>People (2).</strong> [20070809-122912] We&apos;ve seen a whole lot of people (see above), but haven&apos;t actually <em>met</em> many. This is partly due to the fact that we&apos;re traveling as a family, but also partly a result of the type of people we are. Neither Nicoline nor I are the sort of person to go to a bar or local cafe or start chatting with strangers somewhere. That is one thing I would like to have done differently, although I wouldn&apos;t know how to do that. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;<strong>Home.</strong> [20070809-111809] Tomorrow we finish our seventh week, one more week after that and we&apos;ll be back home. We were musing about that yesterday, how none of us is really homesick. Sure, Frank is longing to see the computer back, and Mark to see our cat again, and Nicoline and I are getting a bit tired of the driving and the going in and out of hotels, but no real homesickness at all. When we suggested to maybe skip Boston and go straight home from Detroit, neither Frank nor Mark wanted to hear about that!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We still have a week to go, but I think I already can say this vacation is a success.

US-30, the road we&apos;re continuing to follow all day today, is also known as the \"Lincoln Highway.\" The Lincoln Highway was the first highway to cross the entire U.S., predating the highway system with the numbered roads (the \"US-\" numbers). The sign at the historic Lincoln Highway bridge in Tama, Iowa explains some of its history. [20070809-091608]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The American Highway System (\"US-\" roads) was created on November 11, 1926 and established a network of roads, laid out a systematic numbering schema, and provided a system of standard signs for the highways. It served to make the United States a nation based on the automobile. [20070809-145532]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;By the 1950s, however, many highways had fallen in disrepair, because the responsibility for maintaining the highways remained with the individual states. On June 29, 1956, president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a law that created the Interstate system; 41,000 miles of limited-access freeways that are maintained by federal money. The interstates, without intersections or traffic lights, bypassing city centers, provided an efficient way for any American to get from point A to point B. The interstate system was completed in 1991. (Source: 2006 edition of the Washington State Highway Map.) [20070803-080759]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Anyway, we&apos;re on the Lincoln Highway today and pass the Lincoln Highway bridge in Tama, Iowa. [20070809-091720] We also pass a number of trains that seem to be backed up (again), waiting at red signals.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Corn fields galore today. Most of them are just corn fields, but some have series of signs with numbers on them. [20070809-094525] I think these are different types of corn, and the series of sign may indicate an experimental section where they try out different variants.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Frank is playing around with the GPS today and notices when we enter Illinois that we are about to pass the 90-degree meridian. We stop exactly at the point where the GPS indicates 90 degrees, [20070809-122829] meaning we&apos;re 1/4 around the earth from Greenwich, England. By the way, we bought the GPS for this trip, thinking that it might come in handy when we would be in some of the wilder areas of the country, but we haven&apos;t seriously used it once. We haven&apos;t had the urge to stray that far from the marked paths!&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We look for a hotel to the south side of Chicago. Once more, it takes some time to find a place to sleep. Even here, where there are many hotels and motels clumped together, plenty of them seem to be sold out. I don&apos;t know what that is with places being sold out all over the country! I mean, in the end we have found something every day, but I guess the travel industry must be doing well these days if so many places are full.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We carry out stuff up and walk over to a Cracker Barrel which Nicoline noticed just behind the hotel to have our dinner.','2007-08-11 14:37:06','C','2007-08-11 14:37:06','N'),('200708100001','eric','20070810','Chicago','We compressed our driving schedules, leaving us today with an opportunity to visit Chicago.

If I remember David Halberstam&apos;s \"The Fifties\" correctly, Kroc had come across the McDonald&apos;s brothers restaurant in San Bernadino, CA, while he was a salesman for a company that made milkshake mixers. He sold them a custom-made one that could mix the shakes right in the cardboard cups in which they were sold, which was more efficient. He was very impressed with the way the brothers ran their place, so they went into the hamburger business together. But while Kroc wanted to build a hamburger empire, the McDonald&apos;s brothers just wanted to make a nice living, so in the end they had a falling-out. Kroc bought out the brothers and then trademarked the name \"McDonald&apos;s\" and the golden arches, and an empire was born. Halberstam also recounts how Kroc used to walk along Lee Street in Des Plains to pick up discarded cups and wrappers, so the area would look clean and neat to potential customers, and how he would salvage unused condiment packages. A lot has changed since 1955... They look at you funny when you return unopened ketchup packets to the condiment bar now.

Well, we visit Topeka Kansas and we go to a zoo. That&apos;s the only thing that we&apos;ve done for me since then. And a small pool in the middle of nowhere. SMALL. Well, we get to Iowa, and we go to the Higgins memorial. That was kinda cool. Then we go to Chicago. We visit the Sears Tower, it was a let down. Not a good view, cloudy, and boring. And expensive. A postcard cost 5 dollars! We leave and have lunch at a pizza joint. Where the ice cubes didn&apos;t move. Even when the water was gone, they stayed until you poked them down. We leave that and head to Mickey-D&apos;s place. And Chicago O&apos;Hare. BORING. We go find a hotel then go nap nap. We wake up and head to Detroit. We get there and go to the Motown museum. Kinda interesting. We leave that and get a snack at an ice cream truck.We go and head to the Henry Ford Museum, but, we can&apos;t find it! We do eventually find it, and go there, but the Factory tour is over. We decide to head back again tomorrow. We go back to the hotel and go to sleep. Well, not really. We went to AppleBees for diner, and I get a children&apos;s menu to entertain myself. But still order of the adult. Sadly, I left the crayons in my pocket when my clothes were watched, so I ruined a entire batch of clothes... No make it up to my parents, I sneak out in the middle of the night and get Mom a flower. I sneak back, put the flower into a cup, and go to bed. I wake up and ask if Mom saw my flower. She said yes, and that she was not angry with me anymore. After that, we went to breakfast and leave for the Henry Ford Museum. We get there, take the tour, and go to lunch. I&apos;ll let Mom explain the tour, seeing as she wanted to do it so badly. We eat lunch, but the people mess up my order. They cooked my meat to medium rare instead of well done. I was to lazy to give it back, but I didn&apos;t eat much. I wasn&apos;t that hungry anyway.

It&apos;s really foggy, the short stretch through Indiana, [20070811-082138] but that clears up when we enter Michigan.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The drive through Michigan is quite uneventful. [20070811-121054] We do see plenty of car building-related things coming up, like this tire \"billboard.\" And it is noticeable that the ratio of American to foreign cars is shifting. The closer we get to Detroit, the more American cars we see and the fewer foreign-made ones.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;The Motown museum is in a residential neighborhood; this is where Motown was founded and had it studios for a long time, with Barry Gordy, the founder, living in an apartment on the second floor. [20070811-122730]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Photography is not allowed inside the museum (unfortunately) but the tour, and seeing the original recording studios, was interesting. [20070811-122638] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Since it was still early (in our hurry to get to Detroit on time for the museum, we actually got there by noon, which still ended as 1:00 since we went back to Eastern Time), we tried to see if we could visit the Henry Ford museum. After a little bit of back and forth we got there. We really want to do the factory tour, but the last one had already left. We looked at doing the museum, but at another $14 per person decided we&apos;d skip on that. It seemed the museum was not so much about the Ford company as it was about the US in general. In addition, I found the fact that the Ford charges for parking <strong>on top of</strong> their sizable entry fees exorbitant. I guess they know better how to make money with their museum than with their cars (which are loosing money year after year)... [20070811-150312]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After deciding to come back for the factory tour tomorrow, we turned to find our hotel which we had booked in Toledo, OH, about an hour drive. We had been warned that Detroit was an expensive place for gas, so it had surprised us that gas prices actually went <em>down</em> by 20 cents a gallon when we got there from the Chicago area; driving on to Toledo they went down by <em>another</em> 20 cents: we filled up the car for $2.56 a gallon, after having paid $3.04 a gallon yesterday in the Chicago area...','2007-08-14 12:47:37','C','2007-08-14 12:41:49','N'),('200708120002','eric','20070812','Ford Factory Tour','As I mentioned yesterday, we had to come back to Detroit today to do the factory tour.

[20070812-101846] Not surprisingly, photography is not permitted on the actual factory floor, but I can take my camera to use on other parts of the tour.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In the visitors building, we first get to watch two films: one about the history of the company and the factory, the other one a multi-sensory \"experience\" about how trucks are build in this plant. After that we go to the observation floor, looking out over the factory. [20070812-113523]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Interestingly, the final assembly hall (the part of the factory we can visit) is a modern building with a lot of thought about ergonomics and the environment. Large skylights let in natural light, and the roof has plants on it that help with absorbing rain water, providing insulation to the building, lasts longer, and weighs less. [20070812-113806] They also use open asphalt in places, which allows the rain water to be filtered and cleaned before streaming to the river, and they don&apos;t mow the grass to increase its ability to clean the air. It seems that with this new factory Ford is really trying to be more environmentally friendly.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;In the plant we see the assembly of the Ford F-150 trucks. The plant is shut down for the weekend (Ford can&apos;t sell as many cars as they can make, so they have to limit production) which is always a cool thing to see. After walking around the factory, we come to a museum-like part where some of the Ford cars that were made in this particular factory were on display.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;[20070812-122527] [20070812-122655] [20070812-122840] [20070812-122214]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After the factory tour we have an extensive lunch at La Shish, an Middle-Eastern restaurant in Dearborn.

The Ford people make a big to-do about calling it the \"Ford Rouge Plant\" because of its location on the Rouge River and because this was apparently Henry Ford&apos;s dream come true. He not only wanted to have a factory where he could build cars that would cost less than any other car on the market, but he also wanted to control the steel production and the coal necessary for the production of said steel. In fact, in that respect he was probably a lot like John D. Rockefeller, who wanted to control every aspect of oil production. [20070812-094221] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We bought tickets for the factory tour at the musuem and then waited for the bus to take us to the plant. The tour began with an introductory movie about Henry Ford and the history of the Ford Motor Company, co-produced by the company and the United Auto Workers. Not surprisingly, they make it sound as though the partnership with the union has been the greatest blessing to the Ford Motor Company, but many of the problems the car maker has these days relate to the promises made to the union that Ford Motor Company would not only pay generous pension benefits, but also continue to provide health care to their retired workers. [20070812-101728] [20070812-102202] [20070812-103044] [20070812-101846] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;What Ford is doing at the plant to protect the environment, however, is quite impressive. For instance, most of their parking lots are not covered with regular asphalt, but with a special kind of porous asphalt, that lets water drain tthrough underground filtering systems instead of just running into rivers and streams as run-off. They also re-use the energy used in painting the cars to generate electricity for part of the plant, and they have \"green\" roofs, which allow for a substantial reduction in heating and cooling costs, as well as run-off. [20070812-113806] [20070812-113945]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;However, what would probably do the Ford Motor Company&apos;s bottom line more good in the long run would be to set some serious CAFE standards instead of the wimpy ones the auto industry still insists on. One way to achieve this, in my humble opinion, would be to quit overbuilding their light trucks. Most people I know who own pick-up trucks hardly ever use them to haul heavy loads or pull heavy tows. They drive a truck because it&apos;s so much more macho than driving the world&apos;s largest diaper bag, also known as the minivan. Instead of \"building Ford tough,\" build it as lightweight as possible and have a line of workhorse trucks like the F350 or something similar for those who really need the power. &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After we looked at the classic Fords, from the Model A (the Model T was apparently never built at the Rouge plant; at any rate, it wasn&apos;t on view) to the Mustang, we went into the gift shop. Now maybe I&apos;m just being silly, but if I go into the gift shop at the Ford factory, I expect to be able to buy stuff with the Ford logo on it. I was looking for a postcard with the familiar blue and white logo, to send to my parents. My paternal grandfather used to work at the Ford factory in Holland and they used to vacation at a Ford recreation site as well, where I used to visit them when I was a kid. However, the only thing they had with the Ford logo was a set of playing cards for $8.95. Yeah, right! So we ended up taking a picture of the Ford logo in the parking lot back at the museum.[20070812-122201] [20070812-122003] [20070812-122010] [20070812-122017] [20070812-122116] [20070812-125529] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Dearborn, for some reason, has a large Arab community and there are lots of restaurants that feature Middle Eastern cuisine, so we had a very nice lunch at \"La Shish.\" [20070812-133018]','2007-08-14 15:11:11','C','2007-08-14 14:44:20','N'),('200708130001','nicoline','20070813','Sandusky and Toledo, OH','Today was probably the day the kids had looked forward to the most.

He won a shark which he promptly named Steve. I did the guessing game, and I won a teddy bear which I named Goofa.

The weather was kind of dreary for the first half of the trip, so it didn&apos;t look like much, but when the sky cleared it looked a lot prettier. It was very flat country, and at some points we could see Lake Erie to the south. We had to stop and get gas. At some stations the sign said \"we serve\" as opposed to \"self serve\" and of course the quantity is measured in liters (\"litres,\" since the Canadians use English spelling), which the kids thought was pretty fascinating. Poor things, they think that \"standard\" weights and measures are used all over the world instead of Liberia, Burma and the U.S. We came through a town called Delhi, which called itself the heart of tobacco country. I was surprised to learn they grew tobacco in Ontario, since I&apos;ve always thought tobacco plants need to be warmer than it is likely to be that far north. Also, there was a Delhi-Belgian club, which was kind of surprising.

So he took some kind of ski lift down to the viewing area, while we stayed on the plaza near some hotel/mall/casino.

We looked for accomodation closer to Boston itself, but ended up going to the next town over from Salem, because every hotel I tried was either sold out or had only double beds. In the end it didn&apos;t matter, because that was the only kind the Danvers Days Inn had, but oh well. We&apos;ll survive, and in two days we&apos;ll be sleeping in our own beds.

The over-the-counter drops I bought for him in Chicago didn&apos;t seem to have much of an effect, and by the time we reached Massachusetts, he could barely open his mouth to eat (not that he had much of an appetite). So I found the nearest emergency room and spend the afternoon waiting for a doctor to diagnose Mark with what was clear as day by that time: ear infection. We were at Lahey Clinic in Salem by 4 p.m. and walked out with a prescription for antibiotics in hand around quarter past seven.[20070815-121756]&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;After dropping Mark and me off at the clinic, Eric and Frank went plane spotting at Logan Airport.

Unfortunately, like most of the rest of our last hotel, it is disappointing. Too bad the last \"continental breakfast\" is not very tasty. It&apos;s already hard enough to believe that today is the next to last day of our vacation. Tomorrow we&apos;ll fix our own breakfast, because we intend to be on the road by 4 a.m. at the latest. We want to avoid rush hour traffic around Boston and get a head start on the trip home. The 17th also happens to be Mark&apos;s 14th birthday, and the sooner we get home, the more he&apos;ll get to enjoy it.&lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;However lousy the breakfast was, it did lead me to a flyer for the Salem Ferry, which is a regular ferry service between Salem and Boston. It&apos;s for tourists as well as commuters. One drive around Bean Town during rush hour is enough for Eric, so after some deliberation we decide to head for Salem and the ferry. It turned out to be a catamaran, which took only 45 minutes to get us from one city to the other. It was quite an experience, as we&apos;d never been on one of these before. We have taken ferries on either coast, and two on the Gulf Coast![20070816-091856] [20070816-092126] [20070816-094758] [20070816-100626] [20070816-100727] [20070816-100947] [20070816-101256] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;We arrived at the New England Aquarium Dock at 10.45 a.m. and decide to walk from there to Boston Common following the \"Freedom Trail.\" This self-guided trail is marked on the pavement in red paint or red brick and leads you from one historic site to the next.

Anthony and John F. Kennedy, to name but a few. We also saw the Old State House, where the Declaration of Independence was read to the people of Boston on July 18, 1776. Before that, it had been the place where the latest dictates from London were read to outraged Bostonians. Walking along the trail, we also saw the graveyard where the victims of the \"Boston Massacre\" are buried, as well as Paul Revere. When we got to the Commons we had lunch at McDonald&apos;s and then went out again to enjoy America&apos;s oldest public park (according to the AAA tour book) at our leisure. The kids waded in the \"frog pond\" and played in the playground, while we went off to see the bar that formed the inspiration for the sitcom \"Cheers,\" which happened to be located near one of the park entrances on Beacon Street. After that, we walked back to the ferry dock where we caught the 3 p.m. ferry back to Salem.

It depicted the history of the 1692 Salem Witch Hunt in a number of tableaux, which were really well done. When all was said and done, several hundred people had been accused of witchcraft, with 19 of them condemned to hang and one to the even more barbaric fate of death by crushing. Several others died in jail, all because some teenage girls craved some excitement. The museum also did an excellent job of giving a overview of the history of witches and the role the church played in associating witches with forces of evil. It also linked the Salem Witch Hunt to later manifestations of the phenomenon, such as the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and of course McCarthyism in the 1950s. [20070816-170633] [20070816-161752] &lf;&nl;&lf;&nl;Afterward, we went to the Barnes and Noble store near the hospital to sit down, grab a bite to eat and find an internet connection so Eric could update the site one last time before we get home.
